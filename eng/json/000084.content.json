    "content": "<p>Nicodemus was a respected Jewish Pharisee (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:1\">John 3:1</a>) and a prominent member of the high council. He seems to have become a follower of Jesus. The Gospel of John is the only place where he is mentioned.</p><p>Nicodemus was curious about Jesus&apos; authority and miracles. So, Nicodemus visited Jesus secretly at night to learn more about him. Jesus told Nicodemus he must be born again to enter the kingdom of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:8\">John 3:1–8</a>). The Gospel does not reveal Nicodemus&apos;s response.</p><p>Later, in contrast to his colleagues on the Jewish high council, he argued strongly that Jesus deserved a fair trial (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:50-John7:51\">John 7:50–51</a>). After Jesus died on the cross, he purchased seventy-five pounds of expensive perfumed ointment for the burial. He took it to the tomb and helped Joseph of Arimathea bury Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:39-John19:42\">John 19:39–42</a>). Thus, Nicodemus seems to be a Pharisee who came to believe in Jesus and was willing to show his commitment publicly after Jesus&apos; death.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:9\">John 3:1–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:50\">7:50</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:39-John19:42\">19:39–42</a></p>",
