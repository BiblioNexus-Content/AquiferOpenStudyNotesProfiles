    "content": "<p>Ishmael was Abraham’s first son, born to Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian servant. The boy was born near Hebron when Abraham was eighty-six years old (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:18\">Genesis 13:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen16:16\">16:16</a>). God promised to make a great nation from the childless Abraham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:2\">Genesis 12:2</a>). God assured him he would have a son as his heir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:4\">15:4</a>). Ishmael was born when Abraham tried to fulfill God’s promise by human means (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:16\">Genesis 16:1–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:23\">Galatians 4:23</a>). But God would still achieve his purposes through Sarah (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:18\">Genesis 17:15–18:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:1-Gen21:7\">21:1–7</a>).</p><p>God said Sarah would have a son to fulfill the promise (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:16\">Genesis 17:15–16</a>). Abraham asked God to accept Ishmael (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:17-Gen17:18\">17:17–18</a>). Ishmael was not the promised son because God&apos;s special agreement (covenant) would be with Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:19\">Genesis 17:19</a>). Still, God blessed Ishmael and made him the father of a great nation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:20-Gen17:21\">Genesis 17:20–21</a>).</p><p>When Ishmael was thirteen, he was circumcised as part of God&apos;s covenant with Abraham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14\">Genesis 17:9–14</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:23-Gen17:27\">23–27</a>). At Isaac&apos;s weaning celebration, when Ishmael was about seventeen, he mocked Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:9\">Genesis 21:9</a>). As a result, Abraham sent Ishmael and Hagar away with supplies. An angel of God helped Hagar survive in the wilderness, and Ishmael became a hunter. He settled in the wilderness of Paran and married an Egyptian woman (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:20-Gen21:21\">Genesis 21:20–21</a>). Ishmael helped bury Abraham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:9-Gen25:10\">Genesis 25:9–10</a>). He gave his daughter Mahalath in marriage to Esau (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:9\">28:9</a>). Abraham died at age 137 (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:17\">25:17</a>). His twelve sons are listed in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:13-Gen25:15\">Genesis 25:13–15</a>.</p><p>Paul mentioned Ishmael to encourage the Galatians to trust in God instead of the law (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31\">Galatians 4:21–31</a>). Those who rely on the law will not inherit the kingdom, just as the slave woman&apos;s son did not inherit with the free woman&apos;s son (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:30\">Galatians 4:30</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen16:11-Gen16:16\">Genesis 16:11–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:18-Gen17:26\">Genesis 17:18–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:8-Gen21:21\">21:8–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:9-Gen25:18\">25:9–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:9\">28:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31\">Galatians 4:21–31</a></p>",
