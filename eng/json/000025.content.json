    "content": "<p>David is one of the most important people in the Bible. His time as king was a very special period in God&apos;s plan for Israel. The things David did as king had a great and lasting effect on Israel&apos;s future.</p><p>David was born in Bethlehem as Jesse’s youngest son. His family history goes back to Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:18-Ruth4:22\">Ruth 4:18–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:3-1Chr2:15\">1 Chronicles 2:3–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:3-Matt1:6\">Matthew 1:3–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:31-Luke3:33\">Luke 3:31–33</a>). When he was born, the Jebusites occupied Jerusalem, and many parts of the promised land were still under foreign control, especially by the Philistines. God would use David to finish conquering the land.</p><p>As a young man, David was a simple shepherd, caring for his father&apos;s sheep (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:11\">1 Samuel 16:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:14-1Sam17:15\">17:14–15</a>). His life changed unexpectedly when the prophet Samuel visited Jesse and anointed David as the future king of Israel. However, David did not become king through a coup or assassination. Instead, he served King Saul faithfully. David first joined Saul&apos;s service as a musician, playing songs that calmed Saul&apos;s troubled mind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:14-1Sam16:23\">1 Samuel 16:14–23</a>). This role foreshadowed David&apos;s work as the composer of many psalms. Young David also helped Saul by famously defeating the Philistine champion Goliath in single combat (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:32-1Sam17:51\">1 Samuel 17:32–51</a>). This victory foreshadowed David&apos;s future as a successful military leader.</p><p>David was loyal, but Saul became very suspicious of him. So, David had to flee. He escaped with help from Saul’s children, Jonathan and Michal. David led a kingdom in exile with an army of six hundred men. The prophet Gad and the priest Abiathar were with him, offering guidance from the Lord.</p><p>God&apos;s patience with Saul eventually ended, and Saul died in battle. Even then, David found it difficult to become the ruler of all Israel. The tribe of Judah quickly made him their king, but the northern tribes initially chose Ishbosheth, Saul&apos;s son, as their leader. Ishbosheth was weak and ineffective; he remained in power only because of his father&apos;s military leader, Abner. However, Ishbosheth insulted Abner, so the general helped transfer the kingdom to David.</p><p>As king of a united Israel, David strengthened the kingdom. He and his men captured Jerusalem from the Jebusites and made it his capital. He forced the last of the Philistines to leave the land. David then brought the ark of the covenant into Jerusalem. He wanted to build a permanent temple for God in Jerusalem to replace the tabernacle. God denied this wish but showed love for David by making a covenant (special agreement) with him, establishing his descendants as a family of kings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:1-2Sam7:29\">2 Samuel 7</a>).</p><p>David&apos;s life soon worsened (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam12:31\">2 Samuel 11–12</a>). When he should have been with his army, he stayed on the palace roof. He saw a beautiful woman named Bathsheba bathing and desired her. So, like other powerful kings of that time who took whatever they wanted, he took Bathsheba. She became pregnant, and his attempt to hide his adultery failed. David was desperate, so he had her husband, Uriah, killed. However, even a great king like David cannot hide secrets from God. God sent his prophet Nathan to confront David. David was sorry for what he had done (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps32:1-Ps32:11\">Psalms 32</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps51:1-Ps51:19\">51</a>). But his actions affected his family and his reign.</p><p>From then on, David&apos;s family began to have many problems and conflicts. David’s son Amnon raped his half-sister Tamar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam13:1-2Sam13:14\">2 Samuel 13:1–14</a>). Her brother Absalom then murdered Amnon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam13:20-2Sam13:29\">2 Samuel 13:20–29</a>). Absalom later started a civil war as he tried to become king instead of his father (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:1-2Sam18:33\">2 Samuel 15–18</a>). Another son, Adonijah, tried to become king instead of David by declaring himself king while his father was still alive (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:5-1Kgs1:10\">1 Kings 1:5–10</a>). But David gathered enough strength to ensure that Solomon would be king after him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:28-1Kgs1:40\">1 Kings 1:28–40</a>). When David died, Solomon became king. Solomon was the first of many kings from David&apos;s family (as promised in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:1-2Sam7:29\">2 Samuel 7</a>).</p><p>Most of the kings who came after David were not as good at leading as he was. His descendants rarely led the nation to worship God faithfully. The united kingdom of Israel did not last beyond Solomon. In the following centuries, David&apos;s descendants ruled only Judah in the south. Eventually, the kingdom of Judah was destroyed. A descendant of David never again ruled as king in Israel.</p><p>What about the promise to David that &quot;your throne will be secure forever&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:16\">2 Samuel 7:16</a>)? The New Testament refers to Jesus. He was a descendant of David, and God declared him the Christ, or Messiah—the anointed king (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:1\">Matthew 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:27\">9:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:23\">12:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:47-Mark10:48\">Mark 10:47–48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:10\">11:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:35-Mark12:37\">12:35–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:38-Luke18:39\">Luke 18:38–39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke20:41-Luke20:44\">20:41–44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:42\">John 7:42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev5:5\">Revelation 5:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev22:16\">22:16</a>). David&apos;s life and rule foreshadow the messianic reign of Jesus Christ, which will last forever (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:32-Luke1:33\">Luke 1:32–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev11:15\">Revelation 11:15</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:13-Ruth4:22\">Ruth 4:13–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:1-1Sam17:58\">1 Samuel 16:1–17:58</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:1-1Sam27:12\">18:1–27:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam29:1-1Sam30:31\">29:1–30:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:1-2Sam24:25\">2 Samuel 1:1–24:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1-1Kgs2:12\">1 Kings 1:1–2:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:1-1Chr29:30\">1 Chronicles 11:1–29:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps32:11\">Psalms 1–32</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps34:1-Ps41:13\">34–41</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps51:1-Ps71:24\">51–71</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps86:1-Ps86:17\">86</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps91:1-Ps110:7\">91–110</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps122:1-Ps122:9\">122</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps124:1-Ps124:8\">124</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps131:1-Ps131:3\">131</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps133:1-Ps133:3\">133</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps138:1-Ps145:21\">138–145</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:1\">Matthew 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:27\">9:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt22:41-Matt22:46\">22:41–46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:35-Mark12:37\">Mark 12:35–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke20:41-Luke20:44\">Luke 20:41–44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:40-John7:44\">John 7:40–44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:22-Acts2:37\">Acts 2:22–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:20-Acts13:43\">13:20–43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:3\">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev22:16\">Revelation 22:16</a></p>",
