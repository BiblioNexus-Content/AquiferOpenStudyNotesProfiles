    "content": "<p>For many years, only the Bible mentioned the Hittite people. Some scholars questioned whether the Bible&apos;s historical accounts about the Hittites were accurate. They thought the Hittites were not a real people. However, archaeologists and historians have uncovered information about them. </p><p>The Hittites had an empire centered in Asia Minor, with their capital at Hattusha (modern Baghazkoy). The empire grew much larger because many cities signed agreements to follow its rule. These cities were not officially part of the empire&apos;s territory, but they had to do what the empire said. The Hittite armies were strong enough to challenge the Egyptian armies under the proud Rameses II, who ruled from 1279 to 1213 BC. The Hittites fought Rameses II at Kadesh on the Orontes around 1274 BC. Neither side won the battle. During the time of Abraham and the other early fathers of Israel, the Hittite people controlled cities in Canaan, such as Hebron.</p><p>Heth, the ancestor of the Hittites, is the second son of Canaan in the &quot;table of nations&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:15\">Genesis 10:15</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:13\">1 Chronicles 1:13</a> and the footnote there). Most mentions of Heth&apos;s sons are in the story of Abraham buying the cave of Machpelah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen23:1-Gen23:20\">Genesis 23</a>). Later, God told the Israelites to destroy all Hittites in the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:2\">Deuteronomy 7:1–2</a>). But the Israelites did not fully obey God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:20-1Kgs9:21\">1 Kings 9:20–21</a>). Some of David&apos;s best warriors were Hittites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6\">1 Samuel 26:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam12:31\">2 Samuel 11–12</a>). Solomon traded with Hittite kings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:29-1Kgs11:1\">1 Kings 10:29–11:1</a>). The Bible shows that the Hittites were important people.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen23:3-Gen23:20\">Genesis 23:3–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen26:34-Gen26:35\">26:34–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:46-Gen28:2\">27:46–28:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut7:1\">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6\">1 Samuel 26:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:2-2Sam11:27\">2 Samuel 11:2–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:20\">1 Kings 9:20</a></p>",
