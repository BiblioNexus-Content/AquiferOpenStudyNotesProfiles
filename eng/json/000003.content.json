    "content": "<p>Abishai was a strong and successful warrior and a leader in David&apos;s army. He was David&apos;s nephew, the son of David&apos;s sister Zeruiah, and the brother of Joab and Asahel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:13-1Chr2:16\">1 Chronicles 2:13–16</a>).</p><p>Abishai was very loyal to David and often suggested violence against David&apos;s enemies. God allowed David and Abishai to enter Saul&apos;s war camp while the troops slept. Abishai wanted to kill Saul, but David stopped him. Later, during Absalom&apos;s revolt, David had to leave Jerusalem. Shimei, a member of Saul&apos;s family, cursed the king, and Abishai wanted to kill Shimei (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5-2Sam16:9\">2 Samuel 16:5–9</a>). David refused this idea twice (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam16:10-2Sam16:13\">2 Samuel 16:10–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:18-2Sam19:23\">19:18–23</a>). Abishai and his brothers&apos; desire for revenge also appeared earlier: After Saul&apos;s general, Abner, killed Abishai&apos;s brother Asahel in self-defense, Joab and Abishai killed Abner in revenge (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:22-2Sam3:30\">2 Samuel 3:22–30</a>).</p><p>Abishai was brave and skilled. He once killed three hundred soldiers in one battle. Because of this, he became the leader of the Thirty, a group of highly skilled warriors, ranking just below the Three (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:20-1Chr11:21\">1 Chronicles 11:20–21</a>). Abishai also achieved a major victory over the Edomites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:12-1Chr18:13\">1 Chronicles 18:12–13</a>). In a battle with the Philistines, Abishai saved David&apos;s life by killing the giant Ishbi-benob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:17\">2 Samuel 21:15–17</a>). Abishai also led the army, and when it split for strategic reasons, he led one group while his brother Joab led the other (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:19\">2 Samuel 10:1–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:18\">18:1–18</a>). Their military efforts were usually very successful.</p><p>Joab&apos;s actions eventually led to his death. However, we do not learn about Abishai meeting the same fate. Like Joab, Abishai was also a violently impulsive military leader.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6-1Sam26:12\">1 Samuel 26:6–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam2:18\">2 Samuel 2:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:30\">3:30</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:39\">39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:10-2Sam10:14\">10:10–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam16:9-2Sam16:12\">16:9–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:8\">18:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:21-2Sam19:23\">19:21–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam20:6-2Sam20:10\">20:6–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:17\">21:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:18-2Sam23:19\">23:18–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:16\">1 Chronicles 2:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:20-1Chr11:21\">11:20–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:12-1Chr18:13\">18:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr19:11-1Chr19:15\">19:11–15</a></p>",
