    "content": "<p>Aaron was Moses&apos; older brother (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:20\">Exodus 6:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod7:7\">7:7</a>). He played an important role in establishing Israel and its institutions, especially the priesthood. He first appears after Moses&apos; calling at the burning bush (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod4:17\">Exodus 3:1–4:17</a>). Moses hesitated to accept his mission from God, saying he was not able to lead the Israelites out of Egypt because he struggled with speech (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:10\">Exodus 4:10</a>). Despite God&apos;s reassurances, Moses continued to resist until God appointed Aaron to speak for him. After that, Aaron often stood by Moses, speaking to the Israelite leaders and demanding that Pharaoh allow the Israelites to leave Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod5:5\">Exodus 5:1–5</a>).</p><p>During the Israelites&apos; time in the wilderness, God chose Aaron and his sons to be priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:1-Exod28:5\">Exodus 28:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod29:1-Exod29:46\">29:1–46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:36\">Leviticus 8:1–36</a>). Aaron became Israel&apos;s first high priest. His role was important on the Day of Atonement. This was the only day when the high priest entered the Most Holy Place to cleanse it from Israel&apos;s sins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34\">Leviticus 16</a>). Before doing this, the high priest had to offer a sacrifice for his own sins.</p><p>Aaron was not a perfect leader. While Moses was on Mount Sinai getting the law from God, Aaron helped the people make an idol (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:35\">Exodus 32</a>). When Moses came back, Aaron made weak excuses and blamed the people. This event led to the death of three thousand Israelites and a plague.</p><p>Aaron and his sister, Miriam, once wrongly questioned Moses&apos; authority. This led to Miriam temporarily having leprosy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:16\">Numbers 12</a>). Later, when other Levites questioned Aaron&apos;s authority, God confirmed Aaron&apos;s role by making his staff bloom with almond blossoms (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num17:1-Num17:13\">Numbers 17</a>). However, because Moses and Aaron questioned God&apos;s authority (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:1-Num20:13\">Numbers 20:1–13</a>), they both died in the wilderness and did not enter the Promised Land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:22-Num20:29\">Numbers 20:22–29</a>).</p><p>Jesus is now the Great High Priest, with more authority and power than Aaron (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb10:39\">Hebrews 7–10</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:14-Exod4:17\">Exodus 4:14–17</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:27-Exod4:31\">27–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:20-Exod6:27\">6:20–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod7:1-Exod7:2\">7:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:1-Exod28:5\">28:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:25\">32:1–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:12\">Numbers 12:1–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:1-Num20:13\">20:1–13</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:22-Num20:29\">22–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:39-Acts7:41\">Acts 7:39–41</a></p>",
