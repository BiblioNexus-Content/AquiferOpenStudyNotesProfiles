    "content": "<p>Rachel was Laban&apos;s younger daughter. She was beautiful, and Jacob loved her more than his other wives. He first met her when he arrived at Paddan-aram in Haran. He helped her remove the stone from a well and watered her father’s sheep (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:10\">Genesis 29:10</a>). Jacob agreed to work seven years for Laban to marry Rachel. The time felt like only a few days because he loved her so much.</p><p>Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Leah, his older and less attractive daughter, before allowing him to marry Rachel. Unlike Leah, Rachel could not have children at first (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:31\">Genesis 29:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:1\">30:1</a>). She gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob to have children for her, resulting in the births of Dan and Naphtali (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:3-Gen30:8\">Genesis 30:3–8</a>). Eventually, Rachel became pregnant and gave birth to Joseph (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:24\">Genesis 30:22–24</a>). Soon after, Jacob left Haran with his wives, children, and possessions.</p><p>Between Bethel and Bethlehem, Rachel died while giving birth to Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:16-Gen35:20\">Genesis 35:16–20</a>). Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb, which remained a landmark even during Saul’s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:2\">1 Samuel 10:2</a>). Rachel and Leah are respected for building up the house of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:11\">Ruth 4:11</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:15\">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, Rachel is shown crying for her children taken into captivity. Matthew refers to Jeremiah’s words during Herod’s killing of male infants around Bethlehem shortly after Jesus’s birth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:16-Matt2:18\">Matthew 2:16–18</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:6-Gen30:24\">Genesis 29:6–30:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:4-Gen31:19\">31:4–19</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:31-Gen31:35\">31–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen33:1-Gen33:7\">33:1–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:16-Gen35:20\">35:16–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:19-Gen46:22\">46:19–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen48:7\">48:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:11\">Ruth 4:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:2\">1 Samuel 10:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:15\">Jeremiah 31:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:18\">Matthew 2:18</a></p>",
