    "content": "<p>Ezra was a priest and scribe (teacher and copier of Scripture). He came from an important family of high priests descended from Zadok (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra7:5\">Ezra 7:1–5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:11-Ezra7:12\">11–12</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:2\">Nehemiah 8:2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:9\">9</a>). He led in Judah after the Jews returned from exile. As a scribe, Ezra was more than a copyist; he was a dedicated student of God&apos;s laws (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:6\">Ezra 7:6</a>). He was qualified to teach, preach, and explain the Scriptures.</p><p>Ezra, an important official who helped the king with Jewish matters in the Persian Empire, visited Jerusalem around 458 BC. He brought items for the Temple and aimed to establish God&apos;s laws and the laws of Persia. One of his first actions was to address the issue of intermarriage with non-Jewish neighbors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra9:1-Ezra10:44\">Ezra 9:1–10:44</a>). Later, after the city walls were rebuilt in 445 BC (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:15\">Nehemiah 6:15</a>), Ezra led the community to follow God&apos;s law more closely (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:13-Neh8:15\">Nehemiah 8:13–15</a>).</p><p>Ezra honored God by managing finances well. The Persian king trusted Ezra&apos;s judgment and let him request more money when needed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:15-Ezra7:20\">Ezra 7:15–20</a>). Ezra gave financial responsibilities to others whenever possible and demanded strict financial honesty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:24-Ezra8:30\">Ezra 8:24–30</a>). He identified some financial resources as sacred and belonging to God.</p><p>Ezra humbled himself before God when the people began their journey (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:21-Ezra8:23\">Ezra 8:21–23</a>), when he learned about the people&apos;s unholy marriages (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra9:5-Ezra9:15\">Ezra 9:5–15</a>), and when he gathered those required to divorce their pagan wives (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:6\">10:6</a>). He always recognized that God&apos;s gracious hand—not his own ability or wisdom—made good things happen (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:6\">Ezra 7:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:9\">9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:28\">28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:18\">8:18</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:22\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:31\">31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra9:8-Ezra9:9\">9:8–9</a>). He studied and lived by God&apos;s Word and taught others to follow what God revealed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:10\">Ezra 7:10</a>). He was a teacher and servant-leader, not a self-important official who dominated others.</p><p>Ezra showed his devotion through prayer and fasting. This showed his strong desire to help people follow God. He set an example for life in the Jewish community after the exile, focusing on God&apos;s Word and worship as main priorities.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra10:44\">Ezra 7:1–10:44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:1-Neh8:18\">Nehemiah 8:1–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:1\">12:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:26\">26</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:36\">36</a></p>",
