    "content": "<p>Philip was among the first to share the good news about Jesus with people outside Judea. Highly respected by early Christians, he was one of seven men selected to manage the food distribution program for needy believers in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:6\">Acts 6:1–6</a>). Philip was a powerful and effective evangelist (preacher of the good news) through the Spirit&apos;s power.</p><p>After Stephen&apos;s death, Christians fled Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:5\">Acts 8:1–5</a>). Philip took the message of Christ to Samaria, a city with diverse people. There, he healed many and drove out evil spirits, and people eagerly accepted his message (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:5-Acts8:8\">acts 8:5–8</a>). Many, including a well-known sorcerer named Simon, were baptized (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:9-Acts8:13\">Acts 8:9–13</a>). </p><p>An angel then guided Philip to travel southwest from Jerusalem toward Gaza (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:26\">Acts 8:26</a>). There, the Spirit led him to meet Ethiopia&apos;s treasurer, who was returning home from Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:27-Acts8:28\">Acts 8:27–28</a>). The Ethiopian asked Philip to explain <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa53:1-Isa53:12\">Isaiah 53</a>. Philip shared the message about Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:30-Acts8:35\">Acts 8:30–35</a>) and baptized the man by the roadside (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:36-Acts8:38\">8:36–38</a>). The Spirit of God then suddenly took Philip to Azotus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:39-Acts8:40\">Acts 8:39–40</a>). He preached the message there and traveled through coastal towns until reaching Caesarea, a large Roman city, where he likely settled (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:40\">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:8-Acts21:9\">21:8–9</a>).</p><p>Many years later, Paul stayed overnight at Philip&apos;s home in Caesarea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:8\">Acts 21:8</a>). By then, people knew Philip as Philip the Evangelist. He had four unmarried daughters, and all of them had the gift of prophecy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:9\">Acts 21:9</a>).</p><p>Philip represents early Christian evangelists. The Holy Spirit empowered and guided them to confirm their message (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:8\">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:4-Acts3:8\">3:4–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts5:12-Acts5:16\">5:12–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:8\">6:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:9-Acts10:20\">10:9–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:2\">13:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:6-Acts16:10\">16:6–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:11-Acts19:12\">19:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:22-Acts20:23\">20:22–23</a>). Philip followed the Spirit&apos;s power and guidance, and God used him to spread the good news beyond Judea.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:5\">Acts 6:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:13\">8:4–13</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:26-Acts8:40\">26–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:8-Acts21:9\">21:8–9</a></p>",
