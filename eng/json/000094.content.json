    "content": "<p>Rebekah was the wife of Isaac. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:67\">Genesis 24</a> tells the story of Abraham’s servant who seeks a wife for Isaac. Following Abraham’s instructions, he traveled to Haran in Aram-naharaim (northwest Mesopotamia) to find Abraham’s relatives. Abraham did not want Isaac to marry a local Canaanite. The servant prayed that the woman God chose for Isaac would offer him a drink and also water his camels (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:12-Gen24:14\">Genesis 24:12–14</a>). This would confirm God’s choice and show her character, hospitality, and work ethic.</p><p>God clearly answered his prayer by providing Rebekah, Bethuel&apos;s daughter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:23\">Genesis 22:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:20\">25:20</a>). Bethuel was the son of Abraham&apos;s brother Nahor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:24\">24:24</a>).</p><p>Abraham’s servant explained how God guided him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:34-Gen24:49\">Genesis 24:34–49</a>). Rebekah’s family saw it as God&apos;s work, but they hesitated to let her leave right away (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:50-Gen24:56\">24:50–56</a>). However, Rebekah showed faith in God&apos;s plan and was ready to leave her family immediately to marry Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:57-Gen24:58\">Genesis 24:57–58</a>). Rebekah&apos;s faith was greatly rewarded. The blessing her family gave her when she left came true when she had the next generation of God&apos;s chosen line with Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:59-Gen24:60\">Genesis 24:59–60</a>).</p><p>Rebekah gave birth to twins, Esau and Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:20-Gen25:26\">Genesis 25:20–26</a>). She favored Jacob, the younger son, because God told her he would be stronger and lead the two (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:23\">Genesis 25:23</a>). Rebekah helped Jacob take the firstborn&apos;s blessing by tricking Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40\">Genesis 27:1–40</a>). She then arranged for Jacob to go to Haran to escape Esau&apos;s anger (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:41-Gen28:5\">Genesis 27:41–28:5</a>). Rebekah&apos;s deceit caused a lasting division in the family. She likely never saw Jacob again. However, she was buried with Isaac in the family burial site (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:31\">Genesis 49:31</a>). She fulfilled God&apos;s plan as the mother of Jacob, the founding father of Israel.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:23\">Genesis 22:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:12-Gen24:67\">Genesis 24:12–67</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:20-Gen25:28\">Genesis 25:20–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen26:7-Gen26:8\">Genesis 26:7–8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen26:35\">35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:5-Gen27:17\">Genesis 27:5–17</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:42-Gen27:46\">42–46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:12\">Genesis 29:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:8\">Genesis 35:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:31\">Genesis 49:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:10-Rom9:13\">Romans 9:10–13</a></p>",
