    "content": "<p>The Hebrew and Aramaic phrase “son of man” means “human being.” However, the figure in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14\">Daniel 7:13–14</a>, who is “like the Son of Man,” seems to be more than just a human being. His exact identity is not given, but his role is clear. The Most High has chosen him to rule an eternal and universal kingdom over all nations. He also represents his people, the holy people of the Most High. They will share in this son of man&apos;s kingdom over all peoples and nations (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:22\">Daniel 7:22</a>).</p><p>The scene around this son of man shows his godly characteristics. The description &quot;coming <span>with the clouds of heaven</span>&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:13\">Daniel 7:13</a> tells us that he comes from heaven (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps68:4\">Psalm 68:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps97:2\">97:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah1:3\">Nahum 1:3</a>). In the book of Exodus, the Lord God covered himself with a cloud (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:9\">Exodus 19:9</a>). God&apos;s people will rise into the clouds when Jesus returns (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:17\">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>), just as he was taken into a cloud when he went up to heaven (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:9\">Acts 1:9</a>). This son of man receives his kingdom with humility and holiness, not by arrogantly seizing it. He is the opposite in character to the little horn (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:8\">Daniel 7:8</a>).</p><p>Jesus calls himself the Son of Man (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:30\">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:24\">26:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:26\">Mark 13:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke21:27\">Luke 21:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:34\">John 12:34</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:56\">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb2:6\">Hebrews 2:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:13\">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev14:14\">14:14</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:7\">Revelation 1:7</a> also connects this figure to Jesus Christ, who was pierced for our sins. God the Father gave Jesus all authority and power to rule everything and to reach people from all nations and kingdoms (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:14\">Daniel 7:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:18\">Matthew 28:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:19-Matt28:20\">19–20</a>). God called Abraham to create a great nation through his people and to bless all nations through him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3\">Genesis 12:1–3</a>). Jesus fulfilled this promise.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14\">Daniel 7:13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:30\">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:24\">26:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:26\">Mark 13:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke21:27\">Luke 21:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:34\">John 12:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:13\">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev14:14\">14:14</a></p>",
