    "content": "<p>Titus was a non-Jewish person (gentile) who became a follower of Jesus. He served as one of Paul&apos;s trusted helpers. Paul wrote one of his last letters to Titus while Titus was helping to strengthen the church in Crete. Titus shows us how the good news about Jesus changed the lives of non-Jewish people. Many of them, like Titus, believed so strongly in this message that they left their homes to help Paul share the good news about Jesus with others.</p><p>We do not know anything about Titus&apos;s background or conversion. His name is not mentioned in Acts. We first hear of him as a non-Jewish believer who went with Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:1\">Galatians 2:1</a>). Importantly, Paul emphasized that Titus was not forced to be circumcised (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:3\">Galatians 2:3</a>).</p><p>Later, as a trusted member of Paul&apos;s team, Titus went on special assignments. Paul sent him to Corinth to handle a difficult situation, likely carrying the demanding letter mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor2:4\">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor2:9\">9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor7:8-2Cor7:9\">7:8–9</a>. This task needed someone who could be both gentle and strong as a leader. Titus seemed to have a stronger personality than Timothy (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:10-1Cor16:11\">1 Corinthians 16:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor7:13-2Cor7:15\">2 Corinthians 7:13–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:6-2Tim1:7\">2 Timothy 1:6–7</a>). </p><p>Titus returned to Paul with good news (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor7:6-2Cor7:7\">2 Corinthians 7:6–7</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor7:13-2Cor7:15\">13–15</a>). After that, Paul sent him back to Corinth with the letter we call <em>2 Corinthians</em>. This letter encouraged the believers to finish their fundraising for the poor believers in Jerusalem. Titus eagerly accepted this task because he loved the Christians in Corinth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor7:15\">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:6\">8:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:16-2Cor8:17\">16–17</a>). Paul described him as a person of integrity and similar to Paul himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:23\">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor12:18\">12:18</a>).</p><p>A few years later, after Paul&apos;s first trial in Rome and his release, he left Titus on the island of Crete to strengthen the church. While Titus was there, Paul wrote a letter to him. In the letter, Paul gave advice on choosing church leaders and encouraged Titus to teach and show godly behavior. Paul then asked Titus to meet him at Nicopolis (in Achaia), where Paul planned to spend the winter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus3:12\">Titus 3:12</a>). Later, shortly before Paul was executed in Rome, he wrote that Titus had gone to Dalmatia (along the Adriatic coast, northwest of modern-day Greece), likely for ministry work there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:10\">2 Timothy 4:10</a>).</p><p>The church historian Eusebius mentions an early tradition that Titus settled on Crete and served as bishop there until he was very old (Eusebius, <em>Church History</em> 3.4.6).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor2:13\">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor7:6\">7:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor7:13-2Cor7:14\">13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:6\">8:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:16-2Cor8:17\">16–17</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:23\">23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor12:18\">12:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:1\">Galatians 2:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:3\">3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:10\">2 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus1:4\">Titus 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus2:1\">2:1</a></p>",
