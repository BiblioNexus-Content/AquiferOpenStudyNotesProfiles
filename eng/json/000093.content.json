    "content": "<p>Rahab was a prostitute and a woman of faith. She remains mysterious even hundreds of years after her brief role in Israel&apos;s history. She believed in Israel&apos;s God and helped two Israelite scouts who visited her house. Because of this, her life was spared when Israel captured Jericho.</p><p>Rahab&apos;s house was on the city wall, so Joshua&apos;s scouts went there when they entered Jericho. Rahab might have been both an innkeeper and a prostitute. Other documents from the Old Testament era mention women who were both innkeepers and prostitutes. If Rahab&apos;s house was an inn, it would have been a sensible place to go. Joshua&apos;s scouts could hope to avoid unwanted attention there.</p><p>Rahab&apos;s agreement with the scouts was a strong statement of faith in Yahweh, the God of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh2:8-Josh2:21\">Joshua 2:8–21</a>). As a Canaanite woman, Rahab likely followed the fertility cult of Baal, the god of storms and rain, and his partner Asherah, the earth goddess. However, after hearing about Israel&apos;s progress toward her land, Rahab realized that Yahweh, the God of Israel, is &quot;<span>God in the heavens above and on the earth below</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh2:11\">Joshua 2:11</a>).</p><p>After Joshua conquered Jericho, Rahab married Salmon from the tribe of Judah. She had a son named Boaz (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:21\">Ruth 4:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:5\">Matthew 1:5</a>). Rahab became Ruth&apos;s mother-in-law, another foreign woman who joined Israel. Rahab was also King David&apos;s great-great-grandmother. She is listed with Moses, David, Samson, and Samuel as an example of faith shown through good deeds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:31\">Hebrews 11:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:25\">James 2:25</a>). Rahab is one of five women, including Mary, mentioned in Matthew&apos;s genealogy of Jesus, the human family tree of God&apos;s Son (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:5\">Matthew 1:5</a>). Rahab shows the wide reach of God&apos;s grace.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh2:1-Josh2:21\">Joshua 2:1–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh6:17\">6:17</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh6:22-Josh6:25\">22–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:5\">Matthew 1:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:31\">Hebrews 11:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:25\">James 2:25</a></p>",
