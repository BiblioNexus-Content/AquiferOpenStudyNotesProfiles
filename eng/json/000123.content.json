    "content": "<p>Zadok was a key figure in the history of Israel&apos;s priesthood. He first appears in the story of 2 Samuel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:17\">2 Samuel 8:17</a>). Some scholars think he might not have been born into a priestly family. However, the Bible states he was a descendant of Aaron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1-1Chr6:15\">1 Chronicles 6:1–15</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:50-1Chr6:53\">50–53</a>). Zadok&apos;s family line traces back to Eleazar, Aaron&apos;s son (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:4-1Chr6:8\">1 Chronicles 6:4–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr24:3\">24:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:2-Ezra7:5\">Ezra 7:2–5</a>). Zadok served with Abiathar, a descendant of Eli. Both were priests of Israel under King David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:17\">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam20:25\">20:25</a>).</p><p>When Absalom rebelled against King David, both Zadok and Abiathar proved their loyalty by bringing the Ark to him, ready to join him in exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:24-2Sam15:29\">2 Samuel 15:24–29</a>). However, David sent them back to Jerusalem to act as his spies.</p><p>Later, David&apos;s son Adonijah tried to take David&apos;s throne with Joab and Abiathar&apos;s help. Zadok wisely chose not to support him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:5-1Kgs1:10\">1 Kings 1:5–10</a>). Abiathar was banished (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:26-1Kgs2:27\">1 Kings 2:26–27</a>), fulfilling the prophecy that Eli&apos;s family would lose the priesthood (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:27-1Sam2:36\">1 Samuel 2:27–36</a>). In this prophecy, God said, &quot;<span>I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest. He will do whatever is in My heart and mind. And I will build for him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed one for all time</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:35\">1 Samuel 2:35</a>).</p><p>Zadok fulfilled the prophecy and became the only high priest under Solomon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:35\">1 Kings 2:35</a>). Zadok’s descendants served as Israel’s priests during the monarchy and beyond. Azariah, the chief priest during Hezekiah’s reign, was from Zadok’s line (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr31:10\">2 Chronicles 31:10</a>). During the exile to Babylon, Ezekiel’s vision of the new temple mentions Zadok’s priestly line (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek40:46\">Ezekiel 40:46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek43:19\">43:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek44:15\">44:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek48:11\">48:11</a>). In the early 100s BC, when the Jews were under Seleucid rule, the high priesthood became a political position and was taken from Zadok’s descendants. Because of Ezekiel’s prophecies, Jewish groups, like those who created the Dead Sea Scrolls, continued to hope for the return of Zadok’s line to the high priesthood. The New Testament states that Jesus Christ now holds the office of the high priest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:11\">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:12-Heb10:25\">10:12–25</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:17\">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:23-2Sam15:37\">15:23–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:5-1Kgs1:53\">1 Kings 1:5–53</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:35\">2:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1-1Chr6:15\">1 Chronicles 6:1–15</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:50-1Chr6:53\">50–53</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:2\">Ezra 7:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek40:46\">Ezekiel 40:46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek43:19\">43:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek44:15\">44:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek48:11\">48:11</a></p>",
