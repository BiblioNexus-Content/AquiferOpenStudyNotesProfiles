    "content": "<p>Joshua was the son of Nun. He was Moses&apos; assistant and became Israel&apos;s leader after him. Joshua led the young nation across the Jordan River into Canaan, the land God promised to Abraham, by faithfully following God&apos;s guidance.</p><p>Before Israel reached Mount Sinai, Joshua led Israel&apos;s warriors when Amalek attacked them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:13\">Exodus 17:8–13</a>). Soon after, he was one of the twelve men Moses sent to explore the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:1-Num13:16\">Numbers 13:1–16</a>). Despite popular opinion, Joshua and Caleb urged Israel to take Canaan immediately (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:22-Num14:9\">Numbers 13:22–14:9</a>). As a result, only they, among the twelve spies, entered Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:30\">Numbers 14:30</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:36-Num14:38\">36–38</a>).</p><p>God chose Moses to appoint Joshua as his successor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:15-Num27:23\">Numbers 27:15–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:9\">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>). After Moses died, Joshua led the Israelites across the Jordan River (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh1:1-Josh1:18\">Joshua 1:1–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh3:1-Josh4:24\">3:1–4:24</a>) to conquer Jericho (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh6:1-Josh6:27\">6:1–27</a>). When Israel lost at Ai, Joshua sought the Lord&apos;s guidance and removed sin from Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh7:1-Josh7:26\">Joshua 7:1–26</a>). Then, Israel defeated Ai (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh8:1-Josh8:29\">8:1–29</a>). Following God&apos;s instructions to Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut11:29-Deut11:32\">Deuteronomy 11:29–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut27:1-Deut28:68\">27:1–28:68</a>), Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh8:30-Josh8:32\">Joshua 8:30–32</a>). There he read the blessings and curses of God&apos;s special agreement (covenant) with Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh8:33-Josh8:35\">8:33–35</a>). Joshua led campaigns against two groups of Canaanite kings, one in the south and one in the north (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:43\">Joshua 10:1–43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:1-Josh11:15\">11:1–15</a>). These victories allowed the Israelites to settle in the hill country.</p><p>After overseeing the division of land among the tribes of Israel, Joshua received his own share in Ephraim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:49-Josh19:50\">Joshua 19:49–50</a>). He established the cities of refuge where people could go if they accidentally killed someone (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh20:1-Josh20:9\">Joshua 20:1–9</a>). Joshua also established cities for the Levites to live in (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:45\">21:1–45</a>). The Levites were the tribe chosen to serve God in the temple, but they did not receive their own territory like the other tribes of Israel. Instead, they were given these cities spread throughout the land.</p><p>Joshua allowed the two and a half tribes that settled east of the Jordan River to return home (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh22:1-Josh22:9\">Joshua 22:1–9</a>). As he aged, Joshua urged Israel to stay loyal to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh23:1-Josh24:28\">Joshua 23:1–24:28</a>). His farewell speech at Shechem reviewed God&apos;s actions with Israel and ended with the well-known challenge, “<span>choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve… As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:15\">Joshua 24:15</a>). Joshua died at 110 years old and was buried in Timnath-serah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:29-Josh24:30\">Joshua 24:29–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:8-Judg2:9\">Judges 2:8–9</a>).</p><p>Joshua showed great faithfulness throughout his life, except when he dealt with the Gibeonites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:1-Josh9:27\">Joshua 9:1–27</a>). He did not ask the Lord for guidance on a decision. Israel served God faithfully under Joshua and the elders he trained (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:31\">Joshua 24:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:7\">Judges 2:7</a>). Stephen mentions Joshua in his sermon before his martyrdom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:45\">Acts 7:45</a>). The writer of Hebrews uses Joshua&apos;s conquest of Jericho to illustrate faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:30\">Hebrews 11:30</a>). Joshua and Jesus are the same name in the Hebrew language. This connection is meaningful because both men were leaders who helped save people. Joshua helped the people of Israel by leading them into the land of Canaan, where they could live safely, while Jesus leads all who believe in him into eternal salvation.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:15\">Exodus 17:8–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:1-Num14:38\">Numbers 13:1–14:38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:15-Num27:23\">27:15–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:17\">34:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:9\">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh1:1-Josh1:18\">Joshua 1:1–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh4:1-Josh24:33\">4:1–24:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:6-Judg2:9\">Judges 2:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:30\">Hebrews 11:30</a></p>",
