    "content": "<p>Asa became the third king of Judah after Solomon&apos;s empire split into separate kingdoms. Asa became king after his father, Abijah, who ruled briefly from 913 to 910 BC. Asa reigned for 41 years, from 910 to 869 BC.</p><p>At the start of his reign, Asa was a good king. He opposed the worship of false gods, destroyed the Asherah pole his grandmother Maacah had set up, and removed her political influence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:13\">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr15:16\">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>).</p><p>In the early days of Asa&apos;s reign, God gave him military victories and peace. Asa expelled or defeated anyone trying to conquer, divide, or destroy Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr14:1-2Chr14:8\">2 Chronicles 14:1–8</a>). Asa&apos;s most remarkable victory was over an Ethiopian leader named Zerah, who attacked Judah with over a million troops. Due to Asa&apos;s obedience and faithfulness, God granted him a great victory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr14:9-2Chr14:15\">2 Chronicles 14:9–15</a>).</p><p>Sadly, Asa&apos;s attitude changed near the end of his life. He stopped trusting in God. Baasha, the king of the northern kingdom, attacked Judah with help from Ben-hadad, king of Aram, and strengthened the city of Ramah. Asa paid the king of Aram to switch sides and support him instead of Baasha. This showed Asa trusted a foreign king more than the Lord. Worse, Asa paid Ben-hadad with gold and silver he had previously given to the temple! Asa&apos;s strategy worked, and the northern kingdom of Israel had to leave Judah to deal with Ben-hadad&apos;s threat from the north. However, the prophet Hanani criticized Asa for his lack of faith in God. Angered, Asa imprisoned Hanani (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr16:7-2Chr16:10\">2 Chronicles 16:7–10</a>).</p><p>In the last years of his reign, Asa had a serious foot disease. Despite the severity of his illness, he did not seek the Lord&apos;s help. Instead, he relied only on his doctors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr16:12\">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>). Even so, when Asa died, they buried him with honor in the royal tombs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr16:14\">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:8-1Kgs15:24\">1 Kings 15:8–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr14:1-2Chr16:14\">2 Chronicles 14:1–16:14</a></p>",
