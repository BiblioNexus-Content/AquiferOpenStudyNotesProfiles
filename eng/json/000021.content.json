    "content": "<p>Caleb is an inspiring example of faith in God. He was the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh14:6\">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:12\">Numbers 32:12</a>). The Kenizzites lived in the Negev, the southern desert region of Canaan (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:18-Gen15:21\">Genesis 15:18–21</a>). Jephunneh likely married into the tribe of Judah a generation before Israel left Egypt.</p><p>Caleb first appears as one of the twelve spies Moses sent to explore the land of Canaan. Upon returning, all twelve confirmed the land was impressive, but ten of the scouts focused on its fearsome residents (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:31-Num13:33\">Numbers 13:31–33</a>). Only Joshua and Caleb believed that God would help Israel conquer the Canaanites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:6-Num14:9\">Numbers 14:6–9</a>), advising the Israelites to take the land immediately (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:30\">Numbers 13:30</a>). </p><p>The people wanted to stone Caleb and Joshua (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:10\">Numbers 14:10</a>). But God protected them and punished the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:11-Num14:38\">Numbers 14:11–38</a>). God ultimately rewarded Caleb and Joshua for their faithfulness: Among all the adults who left Egypt, they were the only ones to enter the promised land.</p><p>After many years in the wilderness and fighting many battles, Caleb received his inheritance in the land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh14:6-Josh14:15\">Joshua 14:6–15</a>). Caleb&apos;s faith remained strong over forty-five years. His story shows his character and firm faith in God. Although Caleb was eighty-five years old, he was still strong and able to fight. Caleb took Hebron as his land by driving out the giant Anakites who had scared the earlier scouts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:13-Josh15:14\">Joshua 15:13–14</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:28\">Numbers 13:28</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:33\">33</a>). </p><p>Caleb lived in the city of Hebron, which was about twenty miles south of Jerusalem. This city was close to where the Kenizzite people lived. Later, Hebron became a special city where the Levites (priests) lived and where people could go for safety (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:13\">Joshua 21:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:54-1Chr6:57\">1 Chronicles 6:54–57</a>).</p><p>Caleb focused on God&apos;s promise that Israel would live in Canaan, despite serious obstacles. With full energy, he was ready to take the land Joshua gave him. Caleb&apos;s strong belief in God&apos;s promises made him respected among the faithful. Even when he was outnumbered by enemies, Caleb trusted God, and God rewarded him greatly.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:1-Num14:38\">Numbers 13:1–14:38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:65\">26:65</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:12\">32:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:19\">34:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut1:36\">Deuteronomy 1:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh14:6-Josh14:15\">Joshua 14:6–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:13-Josh15:19\">15:13–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:11-Judg1:15\">Judges 1:11–15</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:20\">20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:15\">1 Chronicles 4:15</a></p>",
