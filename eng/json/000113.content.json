    "content": "<p>The Philistines lived on the southeast coastal plain of the Mediterranean. They were part of a larger group of sea travelers from the Aegean region, called the &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; by the Egyptians. Around 1200 BC, they settled on the lower coastal plain of Palestine and founded the five cities of: </p><ol><li><p>Ashdod</p></li><li><p>Ashkelon</p></li><li><p>Ekron</p></li><li><p>Gaza</p></li><li><p>Gath</p></li></ol><p>The Philistines were not simple; they were skilled in politics and technology. They were also strong warriors. Their iron technology made them nearly unbeatable enemies (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam13:19-1Sam13:22\">1 Samuel 13:19–22</a>). They often fought the Israelites during the time of the judges, around 1350 to 1050 BC, and the early united monarchy, from about 1050 to 970 BC. Saul died fighting the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam31:1-1Sam31:13\">1 Samuel 31:1–13</a>). However, David defeated them before he became king (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:20-1Sam18:30\">1 Samuel 18:20–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:8\">19:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:1-1Sam23:5\">23:1–5</a>) and continued to win against them during his rule (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:17-2Sam5:25\">2 Samuel 5:17–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:1\">8:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15\">21:15–22</a>). Although the Philistines never fully disappeared while Israel existed as a nation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:8\">2 Kings 18:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr17:11\">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr21:16-2Chr21:17\">21:16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:6-2Chr26:7\">26:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:18\">28:18</a>), David effectively ended their threat.</p><p>In 1 Samuel, God used the Philistines to remove Eli&apos;s sinful family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:10-1Sam4:22\">1 Samuel 4:10–22</a>). The Philistines also helped build David&apos;s military and political career (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:32-1Sam17:58\">1 Samuel 17:32–58</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:20-1Sam18:30\">18:20–30</a>). They distracted Saul when he was close to capturing David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:26-1Sam23:28\">1 Samuel 23:26–28</a>). They gave David refuge from Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15\">1 Samuel 21:10–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:1-1Sam27:12\">27:1–12</a>). They stopped David from fighting his own people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam29:1-1Sam29:11\">1 Samuel 29:1–11</a>). They killed Saul and his sons (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam31:1-1Sam31:13\">1 Samuel 31:1–13</a>). This made it possible for David to become king. However, in the end, the Philistines experienced God&apos;s judgment (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:15-Ezek25:17\">Ezekiel 25:15–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos1:6-Amos1:8\">Amos 1:6–8</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:13-Gen10:14\">Genesis 10:13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:1-Judg3:3\">Judges 3:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg13:1-Judg16:31\">Judges 13:1–16:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam5:1-1Sam6:18\">1 Samuel 5:1–6:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam13:16-1Sam14:23\">13:16–14:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15\">21:10–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:1-1Sam23:5\">23:1–5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:26-1Sam23:28\">26–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam31:1-1Sam31:10\">31:1–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:17-2Sam5:25\">2 Samuel 5:17–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:1\">8:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:22\">21:15–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:8\">2 Kings 18:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr17:10-2Chr17:11\">2 Chronicles 17:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr21:16-2Chr21:17\">21:16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:6-2Chr26:7\">26:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:18-2Chr28:19\">28:18–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa2:6\">Isaiah 2:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:15-Ezek25:17\">Ezekiel 25:15–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos1:6-Amos1:8\">Amos 1:6–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos9:7\">9:7</a></p>",
