    "content": "<p>Sarah was both Abraham&apos;s wife and half-sister (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:29\">Genesis 11:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen20:12\">20:12</a>). She traveled with Abraham from Ur to Haran and then to Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:31\">Genesis 11:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:5\">12:5</a>). Twice, in Egypt and Gerar, Abraham asked Sarah to claim she was his sister, not his wife (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20\">Genesis 12:10–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen20:1-Gen20:18\">20:1–18</a>). He feared he might be killed because of her. Despite Abraham&apos;s lack of faith, God protected Sarah both times. This preserved the chosen line through which God promised to grow the Israelite nation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:2\">Genesis 12:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:19\">17:19</a>).</p><p>Sarah is one of several women in the Bible who could not have children but miraculously had a son (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:24\">Genesis 30:22–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:9-1Sam1:20\">1 Samuel 1:9–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:14-2Kgs4:17\">2 Kings 4:14–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:5-Luke1:25\">Luke 1:5–25</a>). After God made several promises, Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to Isaac. Sarah was ninety years old when this happened, showing God&apos;s power to do what seems impossible (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:17\">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:1-Gen21:5\">21:1–5</a>). Her name changed from Sarai to Sarah when God promised Isaac&apos;s birth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:16\">Genesis 17:15–16</a>). Sarah is honored for her faith, even though she laughed at the prediction of Isaac&apos;s birth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:10-Gen18:15\">Genesis 18:10–15</a>). This happened twenty-five years after God&apos;s first promise to Abraham.</p><p>Sarah died at age 127 and was buried in the cave Abraham bought at Machpelah  (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen23:1-Gen23:20\">Genesis 23</a>). She is known as the mother of the nation of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa51:2\">Isaiah 51:2</a>), just as Abraham is its father. She plays a key role in stories about Abraham’s faith (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:19\">Romans 4:19</a>). She symbolizes the freedom Christians have (as children of Sarah, the free woman) through faith in Christ (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31\">Galatians 4:21–31</a>). Peter uses her as an example of holy submission (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:5-1Pet3:6\">1 Peter 3:5–6</a>). The writer of Hebrews presents Sarah as an example of faith, for she believed in God’s ability to keep his promises (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:11-Heb11:12\">Hebrews 11:11–12</a>). Her life shows that God is faithful, even if his timing does not always match our expectations.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:29-Gen11:31\">Genesis 11:29–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20\">12:10–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:22\">17:15–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:9-Gen18:15\">18:9–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen20:1-Gen20:18\">20:1–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:1-Gen21:13\">21:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen23:1-Gen23:20\">23:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa51:2\">Isaiah 51:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:19\">Romans 4:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:6-Rom9:9\">9:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31\">Galatians 4:21–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:11-Heb11:12\">Hebrews 11:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:6\">1 Peter 3:6</a></p>",
