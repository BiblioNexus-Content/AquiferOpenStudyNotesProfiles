    "content": "<p>John the Baptist was a passionate preacher who lived in the desert and called people to repent (to change their lives by stopping their wrongdoing and turning to God). He became known as &quot;the Baptist&quot; (or &quot;the Baptizer&quot;) because he baptized (immersed) people in water as a sign that they were turning away from their sins. John acted like Elijah to prepare people for the Messiah&apos;s arrival (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal4:4-Mal4:5\">Malachi 4:4–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:14\">Matthew 11:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:12\">17:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark9:13\">Mark 9:13</a>).</p><p>John&apos;s birth, like Jesus&apos;, was extraordinary. John&apos;s parents were very old and unable to have children (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:5-Luke1:25\">Luke 1:5–25</a>). His mother, Elizabeth, was a relative of Mary, Jesus&apos; mother (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:36\">Luke 1:36</a>). So, John was related to Jesus. These two miraculous births around the same time marked the start of God&apos;s redeeming work.</p><p>John was filled with the Holy Spirit from birth and dedicated his life to preparing people for the Lord&apos;s arrival (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:15-Luke1:17\">Luke 1:15–17</a>). He began teaching people when he was about thirty years old while living in the desert (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:80\">Luke 1:80</a>). He wore clothes made of camel&apos;s hair with a leather belt, similar to what ancient prophets wore, and ate desert food (locusts and wild honey, see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:4\">Matthew 3:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:6\">Mark 1:6</a>). John urged everyone to repent and be baptized (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:1-Matt3:2\">Matthew 3:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:4\">Mark 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:1-Luke3:3\">Luke 3:1–3</a>). He even criticized the religious leaders who came to listen to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:7-Matt3:10\">Matthew 3:7–10</a>).</p><p>John baptized Jesus, though at first he felt unworthy to do so (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:13-Matt3:17\">Matthew 3:13–17</a>). John knew Jesus was greater than him. While John used water, Jesus would &quot;baptize with the Holy Spirit&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:33\">John 1:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:11\">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:7-Mark1:8\">Mark 1:7–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:16\">Luke 3:16</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:23-John3:30\">John 3:23–30</a>). John encouraged his followers to become Jesus&apos; disciples. Many did, including: </p><ul><li><p>Andrew (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:35-John1:40\">John 1:35–40</a>)</p></li><li><p>Apollos (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:24-Acts18:26\">Acts 18:24–26</a>)</p></li><li><p>The twelve disciples at Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:1-Acts19:7\">Acts 19:1–7</a>)</p></li></ul><p>John criticized Herod Antipas for marrying Herodias, his brother Philip&apos;s wife, which was against the law. To satisfy Herodias, Herod imprisoned and then executed John (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt14:3-Matt14:12\">Matthew 14:3–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:17-Mark6:29\">Mark 6:17–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:19-Luke3:20\">Luke 3:19–20</a>). John&apos;s imprisonment marked the start of Jesus&apos; public preaching (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:12\">Matthew 4:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:14\">Mark 1:14</a>).</p><p>Shortly before his death, John appeared confused about Jesus. He sent messengers from prison to ask if Jesus was truly the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one). Jesus did not do what most people expected the Messiah to do. Instead of bringing judgment and a visible kingdom, he brought forgiveness, healing, and a spiritual kingdom. To reassure John, Jesus spoke of the miraculous things God was doing through him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:18-Luke7:23\">Luke 7:18–23</a>).</p><p>John stayed true to his mission throughout his life. He consistently preached about repentance and God&apos;s judgment, even to those who did not want to listen. Jesus called John one of the greatest servants of God who ever lived (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:19\">Matthew 11:2–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:18-Luke7:35\">Luke 7:18–35</a>). John was the last in a long line of prophets who predicted the coming of God&apos;s Kingdom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:16\">Luke 16:16</a>). He stood at the start of a new era, announcing its arrival to everyone willing to hear.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:1-Matt3:15\">Matthew 3:1–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:12\">4:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:14\">9:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:19\">11:2–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt14:1-Matt14:12\">14:1–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:14\">16:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:10-Matt17:13\">17:10–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:24-Matt21:27\">21:24–27</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:31-Matt21:32\">31–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:1-Mark1:9\">Mark 1:1–9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:14\">14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark2:18\">2:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:14-Mark6:29\">6:14–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:28\">8:28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark9:11-Mark9:13\">9:11–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:29-Mark11:33\">11:29–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:13-Luke1:17\">Luke 1:13–17</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:36\">36</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:39-Luke1:43\">39–43</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:57-Luke1:66\">57–66</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:76-Luke1:80\">76–80</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:1-Luke3:21\">3:1–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:33\">5:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:18-Luke7:35\">7:18–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:7-Luke9:9\">9:7–9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:19\">19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:1\">11:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:16\">16:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke20:3-Luke20:8\">20:3–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:6-John1:37\">John 1:6–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:23-John3:36\">John 3:23–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John4:1-John4:3\">4:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:40-John10:42\">10:40–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:5\">Acts 1:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:37\">10:37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts11:16\">11:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:25-Acts18:26\">18:25–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:1-Acts19:7\">19:1–7</a></p>",
