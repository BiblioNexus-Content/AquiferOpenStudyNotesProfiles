    "content": "<p>The Gospels mention four other Marys besides the mother of Jesus:</p><ol><li><p><em>Mary Magdalene, </em>likely from Magdala in Galilee, was freed from demon possession by Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:9\">Mark 16:9</a>). She became a loyal follower and supported Jesus and his disciples financially (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:1-Luke8:3\">Luke 8:1–3</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:55-Matt27:56\">Matthew 27:55–56</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:40-Mark15:41\">Mark 15:40–41</a>). She witnessed Jesus&apos;s death on the cross and his burial (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:55-Matt27:61\">Matthew 27:55–61</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:40-Mark15:47\">Mark 15:40–47</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:25\">John 19:25</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:49\">Luke 23:49</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:55-Luke23:56\">55–56</a>). She went to the tomb early on Sunday morning with burial spices. She was among the first to hear that Jesus had risen from the dead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:8\">Matthew 28:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:1-Mark16:8\">Mark 16:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:11\">Luke 24:1–11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:22-Luke24:24\">22–24</a>). She was also the first to see the risen Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:9-Matt28:10\">Matthew 28:9–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:9-Mark16:11\">Mark 16:9–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:1-John20:2\">John 20:1–2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:11-John20:18\">11–18</a>).</p></li><li><p><em>Mary, the mother of James the younger</em> (not the apostle) and Joseph, was among the women present at Jesus&apos;s death on the cross and his burial (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:55-Matt27:61\">Matthew 27:55–61</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:40-Mark15:47\">Mark 15:40–47</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:49\">Luke 23:49</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:55\">55</a>). Like Mary Magdalene, she was among the first to hear that Jesus had risen from the dead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:8\">Matthew 28:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:1-Mark16:8\">Mark 16:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:11\">Luke 24:1–11</a>). She was also one of the first to see the risen Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:9-Matt28:10\">Matthew 28:9–10</a>).</p></li><li><p><em>Mary of Bethany </em>was Martha and Lazarus&apos;s sister. Jesus loved their family very much (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:5\">John 11:5</a>). Jesus praised Mary for wanting to learn from him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42\">Luke 10:38–42</a>). Soon after Jesus raised her brother from the dead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:32-John11:45\">John 11:32–45</a>), Mary anointed Jesus&apos;s feet with very expensive perfume. Jesus defended her when others said it was wasteful (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:11\">John 12:1–11</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:6-Matt26:13\">Matthew 26:6–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:3-Mark14:9\">Mark 14:3–9</a>).</p></li><li><p><em>Mary, the wife of Clopas,</em> was among the women watching when Jesus died on the cross (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:25\">John 19:25</a>). The New Testament does not mention her husband, Clopas, elsewhere.</p></li></ol><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:55-Matt27:61\">Matthew 27:55–61</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:1\">28:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:40-Mark15:47\">Mark 15:40–47</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:1-Mark16:11\">16:1–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:2-Luke8:3\">Luke 8:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42\">10:38–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:10\">24:1–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:1-John11:6\">John 11:1–6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:17-John11:24\">17–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:3-John12:8\">12:3–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:25\">19:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:1-John20:2\">20:1–2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:11-John20:18\">11–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts12:12\">Acts 12:12</a></p>",
