    "content": "<p>Timothy traveled with Paul for much of Paul&apos;s missionary work. He was one of Paul&apos;s most loved and trusted helpers. Paul wrote two of his last letters to Timothy. At that time, Timothy was leading the church in Ephesus, near the end of Paul&apos;s life.</p><p>Timothy had a devout mother and grandmother (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:5\">2 Timothy 1:5</a>). The Christians in his hometown, Lystra, and nearby Iconium respected him highly. He joined Paul&apos;s missionary team during Paul&apos;s second journey. Paul mentions prophetic words that confirmed Timothy&apos;s selection. Timothy received a special gifting for service through the laying on of hands by the elders and Paul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:18\">1 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:14\">4:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:6\">2 Timothy 1:6</a>). To respect the Jews in the area, Paul had Timothy circumcised (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:1-Acts16:3\">Acts 16:1–3</a>). Paul did this so that Timothy would be accepted by the Jewish people they wanted to teach about Jesus.</p><p>Over the next fifteen years, Paul sent Timothy on special missions to various churches (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:22\">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor4:17\">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:10-1Cor16:11\">16:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:19-Phil2:23\">Philippians 2:19–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess3:1-1Thess3:6\">1 Thessalonians 3:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:3\">1 Timothy 1:3</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:14-Acts17:15\">Acts 17:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:5\">18:5</a>). Paul included Timothy’s name as coauthor in several of his letters (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor1:1\">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil1:1\">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:1\">Colossians 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess1:1\">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:1\">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phlm1:1\">Philemon 1:1</a>). Paul clearly had a close relationship with Timothy and respected him greatly (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:21\">Romans 16:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor4:17\">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess3:2\">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:2\">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim6:11\">6:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:2\">2 Timothy 1:2</a>). As Paul neared the end of his life and awaited his sentence in prison, he strongly desired to see Timothy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:3-2Tim1:4\">2 Timothy 1:3–4</a>). Among all Paul’s coworkers, Timothy is especially praised for his selfless concern for Jesus and his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:20-Phil2:22\">Philippians 2:20–22</a>).</p><p>Paul’s second letter to Timothy (2 Timothy) was written shortly before Paul was killed. In this letter, he encouraged Timothy to be bold and fearless in sharing the good news about Jesus. He urged Timothy to be willing to suffer for Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8\">2 Timothy 1:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:1-2Tim2:3\">2:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:1-2Tim4:2\">4:1–2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:5\">5</a>). This was a strong message for someone who might have been naturally timid (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:6-2Tim1:7\">2 Timothy 1:6–7</a>). Timothy himself seems to have become a prisoner later on (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb13:23\">Hebrews 13:23</a>).</p><p>Timothy was a great example of serving Jesus in humble and unnoticed ways. He devoted himself selflessly and focused on the work of Jesus and his people wherever help was needed. He reminds believers to become strong and effective witnesses for Jesus.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:1-Acts16:3\">Acts 16:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:14-Acts17:15\">17:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:5\">18:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:22\">19:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:4\">20:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:21\">Romans 16:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor4:17\">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:10-1Cor16:11\">16:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor1:1\">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor1:19\">19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil1:1\">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:19-Phil2:23\">2:19–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:1\">Colossians 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess1:1\">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess3:2-1Thess3:6\">3:2–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:1\">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; 1–2 Timothy; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phlm1:1\">Philemon 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb13:23\">Hebrews 13:23</a></p>",
