    "content": "<p>“<span>By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, without knowing where he was going…By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac on the altar</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:8\">Hebrews 11:8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:17\">17</a>). These key events in Abraham’s life show the faithful obedience for which he is best known.</p><p>God summoned Abram from the city of Ur to lead God&apos;s people. Abram&apos;s family ties are in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:26-Gen11:32\">Genesis 11:26–32</a>. Terah had three sons: </p><ol><li><p>Abram</p></li><li><p>Nahor</p></li><li><p>Haran</p></li></ol><p>Terah left Ur with Abram, Abram&apos;s wife Sarai, and Lot, whose father, Haran, had died. On his way to Canaan, Terah settled in the city of Haran (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:31\">Genesis 11:31</a>). God called Abram to a new land while he was still in Ur (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:2-Acts7:4\">Acts 7:2–4</a>). God told Abram, “<span>Leave your country, your kindred, and your father’s household, and go to the land I will show you</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1\">Genesis 12:1</a>). God blessed Abram by making a covenant (special agreement) with him that included promises of great blessing, many descendants, and a new land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3\">Genesis 12:1–3</a>). These promises later saved Israel from destruction when they often failed to keep their covenant with God (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev26:40-Lev26:45\">Leviticus 26:40–45</a>).</p><p>Abram left Haran when he was seventy-five years old. Upon entering Canaan, he first went to Shechem, a Canaanite city between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. God appeared to Abram near the oak of Moreh, which was likely a Canaanite place of worship. Abram built altars there and near Bethel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:6-Gen12:8\">Genesis 12:6–8</a>). He proclaimed the one true God at these places of false worship. Abram later moved to Hebron by the oaks of Mamre and built another altar to worship God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:18\">Genesis 13:18</a>).</p><p>When God promised blessings to Abram again in a vision (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:1\">Genesis 15:1</a>), Abram said he was still childless because Sarai could not have children (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:30\">Genesis 11:30</a>). Eliezer of Damascus was his heir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:2\">Genesis 15:2</a>). The Nuzi documents, found in the ancient Mesopotamian city of Nuzi, explain this. According to Hurrian custom, a wealthy childless couple could adopt an heir, often a slave, who would handle their burial and mourning. However, if a natural son was born after adopting the slave-heir, the son would replace him. It seems Abram adopted Eliezer this way, but God promised Abram&apos;s own son would be his heir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:4\">Genesis 15:4</a>).</p><p>Abram&apos;s life was marked by his belief in the Lord, who considered him righteous due to his faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:6\">Genesis 15:6</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:3\">Romans 4:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:6\">Galatians 3:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:23\">Jamess 2:23</a>). Abram was not declared righteous because he was without sin. He sometimes failed to do what was right—twice he lied about Sarai out of fear, and he tried to have a son with Hagar instead of waiting for God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:5\">Genesis 16:1–5</a>). However, he consistently returned to faith as the main principle of his life before God.</p><p>Abram was eighty-six years old when Ishmael was born to Sarai’s servant, Hagar. When Abram was ninety-nine, the Lord appeared to him and confirmed His promise of a son and blessings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:1-Gen17:27\">Genesis 17</a>). He added circumcision as a sign of this covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14\">Genesis 17:9–14</a>). God also changed Abram’s name to Abraham and Sarai’s name to Sarah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:5\">Genesis 17:5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:15\">15</a>). Abraham laughed at the promise of another son (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:17\">Genesis 17:17</a>). Soon after, the Lord appeared again to Abraham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:15\">Genesis 18:1–15</a>) and repeated the promise of a son. This time, Sarah laughed in disbelief (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:10-Gen18:15\">Genesis 18:10–15</a>). Abraham was one hundred years old, and Sarah was ninety when the Lord fulfilled His promise (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:1\">Genesis 21:1</a>). The long-promised son was born and was named Isaac, meaning “he laughs.”</p><p>The ultimate test of Abraham&apos;s faith occurred when God told him to sacrifice Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:1-Gen22:19\">Genesis 22:1–19</a>). Abraham obeyed, trusting that God would fulfill His plans (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:17-Heb11:19\">Hebrews 11:17–19</a>). As Abraham was about to use the knife, an angel stopped him and provided a ram to sacrifice instead of Isaac. Abraham&apos;s faith was proven (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:10-Gen22:13\">Genesis 22:10–13</a>).</p><p>Christians see Isaac&apos;s sacrifice as a sign of God providing his only Son, Jesus Christ, as a sacrifice for the world&apos;s sins. God fulfilled his promise to Abraham through Jesus Christ, who offers salvation to all who have faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:16-Rom4:17\">Romans 4:16–17</a>), making believers Abraham&apos;s spiritual descendants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:29\">Galatians 3:29</a>). Abraham&apos;s life shows that God is faithful and deserves belief and obedience. The full meaning of God&apos;s promise was realized when the gospel (the good news about Jesus) was shared with all nations, and people from all families of the earth responded in faith (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:6-Gal3:9\">Galatians 3:6–9</a>).</p><p>Abraham was called God&apos;s friend (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:7\">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:23\">James 2:23</a>). Everyone who lives by faith should try to live like him, trusting God&apos;s guidance and support each day. Abraham is one of many great &quot;witnesses&quot; to a life of faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:1\">Hebrews 12:1</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:1-Heb11:40\">Hebrews 11</a>). He inspires believers to keep their faith because we know God is faithful.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:26-Gen25:11\">Genesis 11:26–25:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen26:2-Gen26:5\">26:2–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:15-Exod3:16\">Exodus 3:15–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:3\">6:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:13\">32:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:2-Josh24:3\">Joshua 24:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:27-1Chr1:34\">1 Chronicles 1:27–34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:7\">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa29:22\">Isaiah 29:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa41:8\">41:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa51:1-Isa51:2\">51:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek33:24\">Ezekiel 33:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:2\">Matthew 1:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:9\">3:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:11\">8:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt22:31-Matt22:33\">22:31–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31\">Luke 16:19–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:31-John8:58\">John 8:31–58</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:2-Acts7:8\">Acts 7:2–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:1-Rom4:23\">Romans 4:1–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:5-Rom9:9\">9:5–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:16-Rom11:17\">11:16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:6-Gal3:29\">Galatians 3:6–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:13-Heb6:15\">Hebrews 6:13–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:8-Heb11:12\">11:8–12</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:17-Heb11:19\">17–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:21-Jas2:23\">James 2:21–23</a></p>",
