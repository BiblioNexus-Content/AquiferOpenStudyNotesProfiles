## Abishai (id: 500494)

Abishai was a strong and successful warrior and a leader in David's army. He was David's nephew, the son of David's sister Zeruiah, and the brother of Joab and Asahel ([1 Chronicles 2:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:13-1Chr2:16)).

Abishai was very loyal to David and often suggested violence against David's enemies. God allowed David and Abishai to enter Saul's war camp while the troops slept. Abishai wanted to kill Saul, but David stopped him. Later, during Absalom's revolt, David had to leave Jerusalem. Shimei, a member of Saul's family, cursed the king, and Abishai wanted to kill Shimei ([2 Samuel 16:5–9](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5-2Sam16:9)). David refused this idea twice ([2 Samuel 16:10–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:10-2Sam16:13); [19:18–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:18-2Sam19:23)). Abishai and his brothers' desire for revenge also appeared earlier: After Saul's general, Abner, killed Abishai's brother Asahel in self\-defense, Joab and Abishai killed Abner in revenge ([2 Samuel 3:22–30](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:22-2Sam3:30)).

Abishai was brave and skilled. He once killed three hundred soldiers in one battle. Because of this, he became the leader of the Thirty, a group of highly skilled warriors, ranking just below the Three ([1 Chronicles 11:20–21](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:20-1Chr11:21)). Abishai also achieved a major victory over the Edomites ([1 Chronicles 18:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:12-1Chr18:13)). In a battle with the Philistines, Abishai saved David's life by killing the giant Ishbi\-benob ([2 Samuel 21:15–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:17)). Abishai also led the army, and when it split for strategic reasons, he led one group while his brother Joab led the other ([2 Samuel 10:1–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:19); [18:1–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:18)). Their military efforts were usually very successful.

Joab's actions eventually led to his death. However, we do not learn about Abishai meeting the same fate. Like Joab, Abishai was also a violently impulsive military leader.
