## Balaam (id: 500473)

Balaam was a diviner who read signs to predict the future and performed rituals to change it (see study note on Numbers 22:5–6; compare [Joshua 13:22](https://ref.ly/Josh13:22)). He worked for money, so when Balak, the king of Moab, wanted to hire him to curse Israel, he was eager to start. Even when God told him not to go, he hoped God would change His mind because he was very interested in the money ([2 Peter 2:15](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:15)).

Finally, God allowed Balaam to go, but only if Balaam agreed to say what God instructed, aiming to frustrate Balak's plans ([Deuteronomy 23:4–5](https://ref.ly/Deut23:4-Deut23:5)). On the road, Balaam's donkey stopped and refused to move because the angel of the Lord blocked the way. The donkey could see the angel, but Balaam could not. Despite this, Balaam wisely chose not to curse the Israelites when God told him to bless them. To Balak's great frustration, blessing them was all Balaam could do.

Recently, an inscription was found mentioning Balaam son of Beor, a diviner who had visions at night (see [Numbers 22:9–12](https://ref.ly/Num22:9-Num22:12), [20](https://ref.ly/Num22:20)). The inscription was written on a plaster wall at Deir ‘Alla, eight miles east of the Jordan River, near where the Hebrews camped during the Balaam incident. This nonbiblical text, dated 800–750 BC, identifies Balaam as a “seer of the gods.” It reports that the gods, whose names in the inscription resemble *Shaddai* (“Almighty”; see [Numbers 24:4](https://ref.ly/Num24:4), [16](https://ref.ly/Num24:16)), gave Balaam a message and announced judgment upon the world (see [Numbers 24:15–25](https://ref.ly/Num24:15-Num24:25)). The inscription provides rare evidence from outside the Bible about a character in the Bible.

Balaam's character and motives seem mixed in [Numbers 22–24](https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num24:25). [Numbers 25](https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:18) describes how the men of Israel sinned by being with Moabite women and worshiping their gods, which angered God. Although Balaam is not mentioned here, [Numbers 31:16](https://ref.ly/Num31:16) identifies him as the one who started this plot. After his visions ended, Balaam stayed in Moab and looked for ways to harm Israel and earn money. The Israelites killed him shortly after ([Numbers 31:8](https://ref.ly/Num31:8)). Balaam became known as: 

* A magician with bad intentions (see [Deuteronomy 23:4–5](https://ref.ly/Deut23:4-Deut23:5); [Joshua 13:22](https://ref.ly/Josh13:22))
* A false teacher interested only in money (see [Nehemiah 13:2](https://ref.ly/Neh13:2); [2 Peter 2:15](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:15); [Jude 1:11](https://ref.ly/Jude1:11))
* Someone who led Israel into idolatry and immorality ([Numbers 31:16](https://ref.ly/Num31:16); see [Revelation 2:14](https://ref.ly/Rev2:14))
