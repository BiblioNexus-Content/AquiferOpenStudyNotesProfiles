## Babylon (id: 500510)

Babylon, one of the world's oldest cities, was the center of Babylonian civilization. It is often used as a symbol for defiant human pride.

Nimrod founded Babylon a few generations after the flood ([Genesis 10:8–10](https://ref.ly/Gen10:8-Gen10:10)). He was one of the first powerful rulers in history. The name Babylon comes from Babel, which means "gate of god" in the Babylonian language. Babylon was likely where the tower of Babel stood ([Genesis 11:1–9](https://ref.ly/Gen11:1-Gen11:9)). This tower was an early human attempt to create an identity separate from the Creator. Abraham and his family left this proud civilization when they traveled from Ur of the Chaldeans around 2000 BC. Although many kingdoms ruled Babylon over the centuries, the city remained a cultural and religious leader.

### Sumerian Civilization (3200–2000 BC)

The first major civilization in Babylonia was Sumer, located south of Babylon. The Sumerians created cuneiform writing, used by Mesopotamian cultures for three thousand years.

### The Akkadian Empire (2334–2154 BC)

North of Babylon, King Sargon I of Akkad, who ruled from 2339 to 2279 BC, established the capital city of Akkad. He achieved political and cultural dominance over Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire lasted almost two centuries.

### First Babylonian Kingdom (1900–1600 BC)

During the Akkadian Empire, Semitic\-speaking nomads from Syria, known as Amurru or Amorites, migrated into Babylonia. The urbane Babylonians considered them barbarians. Eventually, they established a new Babylonian kingdom under Amorite control. Hammurabi, the sixth king of that dynasty, ruled from 1792 to 1750 BC and expanded the kingdom significantly. However, Babylon's glory was short\-lived. Under Hammurabi's son, the kingdom declined and lasted only another century.

### Assyrian Domination (900–614 BC)

In 851 BC, Assyrian King Shalmaneser III, who ruled from 858 to 824 BC, entered Babylon. He treated the ancient city with respect and allowed its king to remain as a vassal. About 150 years later, around 705 BC, a Babylonian vassal king named Merodach\-baladan led a rebellion. He sent ambassadors to King Hezekiah of Judah for support (see [2 Kings 20:12–19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs20:12-2Kgs20:19); [Isaiah 39](https://ref.ly/Isa39:1-Isa39:8)). Assyria quickly crushed Merodach\-baladan’s rebellion, and its domination continued for another century.

### Neo\-Babylonian Empire (612–539 BC)

The Chaldean prince Nabopolassar took the throne of Babylon from 625 to 605 BC, ending the Assyrian Empire. His son, Nebuchadnezzar II, ruled from 605 to 562 BC. Under Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon became the leading power in the Near East and a city of great splendor (see [Daniel 1–4](https://ref.ly/Dan1:1-Dan4:37)).

After Nebuchadnezzar died, Nabonidus became the next king of Babylon. Nabonidus was once a high\-ranking government official who worked with other kingdoms. He ruled Babylon from about 555 BC to 539 BC. Nabonidus neglected Babylon and lost its support. When Cyrus II of Persia, who ruled from 559 to 530 BC, attacked the city in October 539 BC (see [Daniel 5:30–31](https://ref.ly/Dan5:30-Dan5:31) and study note on Daniel 5:31), the city surrendered without a battle. This surrender marked the end of independent Babylon.

### The Symbolic Enemy of God’s People

In 1 Peter and Revelation, Rome is represented by Babylon. Rome is “BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH” ([Revelation 17:5](https://ref.ly/Rev17:5)). It is portrayed as a very immoral center of wealth and trade, ruling over the earth's kings and persecuting God's people. The earth's kings and merchants will mourn its fall ([Revelation 18:9–19](https://ref.ly/Rev18:9-Rev18:19)). But God's people will celebrate because their oppression has ended and they can worship God freely.
