## Women Named Mary (id: 500540)

The Gospels mention four other Marys besides the mother of Jesus:

1. *Mary Magdalene,* likely from Magdala in Galilee, was freed from demon possession by Jesus ([Mark 16:9](https://ref.ly/Mark16:9)). She became a loyal follower and supported Jesus and his disciples financially ([Luke 8:1–3](https://ref.ly/Luke8:1-Luke8:3); see also [Matthew 27:55–56](https://ref.ly/Matt27:55-Matt27:56); [Mark 15:40–41](https://ref.ly/Mark15:40-Mark15:41)). She witnessed Jesus's death on the cross and his burial ([Matthew 27:55–61](https://ref.ly/Matt27:55-Matt27:61); [Mark 15:40–47](https://ref.ly/Mark15:40-Mark15:47); [John 19:25](https://ref.ly/John19:25); compare [Luke 23:49](https://ref.ly/Luke23:49), [55–56](https://ref.ly/Luke23:55-Luke23:56)). She went to the tomb early on Sunday morning with burial spices. She was among the first to hear that Jesus had risen from the dead ([Matthew 28:1–8](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:8); [Mark 16:1–8](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1-Mark16:8); [Luke 24:1–11](https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:11), [22–24](https://ref.ly/Luke24:22-Luke24:24)). She was also the first to see the risen Jesus ([Matthew 28:9–10](https://ref.ly/Matt28:9-Matt28:10); [Mark 16:9–11](https://ref.ly/Mark16:9-Mark16:11); [John 20:1–2](https://ref.ly/John20:1-John20:2), [11–18](https://ref.ly/John20:11-John20:18)).
2. *Mary, the mother of James the younger* (not the apostle) and Joseph, was among the women present at Jesus's death on the cross and his burial ([Matthew 27:55–61](https://ref.ly/Matt27:55-Matt27:61); [Mark 15:40–47](https://ref.ly/Mark15:40-Mark15:47); see also [Luke 23:49](https://ref.ly/Luke23:49), [55](https://ref.ly/Luke23:55)). Like Mary Magdalene, she was among the first to hear that Jesus had risen from the dead ([Matthew 28:1–8](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:8); [Mark 16:1–8](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1-Mark16:8); [Luke 24:1–11](https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:11)). She was also one of the first to see the risen Jesus ([Matthew 28:9–10](https://ref.ly/Matt28:9-Matt28:10)).
3. *Mary of Bethany* was Martha and Lazarus's sister. Jesus loved their family very much ([John 11:5](https://ref.ly/John11:5)). Jesus praised Mary for wanting to learn from him ([Luke 10:38–42](https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42)). Soon after Jesus raised her brother from the dead ([John 11:32–45](https://ref.ly/John11:32-John11:45)), Mary anointed Jesus's feet with very expensive perfume. Jesus defended her when others said it was wasteful ([John 12:1–11](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:11); compare [Matthew 26:6–13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:6-Matt26:13); [Mark 14:3–9](https://ref.ly/Mark14:3-Mark14:9)).
4. *Mary, the wife of Clopas,* was among the women watching when Jesus died on the cross ([John 19:25](https://ref.ly/John19:25)). The New Testament does not mention her husband, Clopas, elsewhere.
