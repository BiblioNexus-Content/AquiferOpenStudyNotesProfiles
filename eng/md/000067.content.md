## Judah (id: 500464)

Judah is most famous for being the ancestor of King David and of Jesus Christ. Judah was not the oldest son and did wrong things as a grown man ([Genesis 38](https://ref.ly/Gen38:1-Gen38:30)). Despite that, God chose Judah to continue the lineage of King David and of the Messiah (see [1 Chronicles 2:1–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1-1Chr2:17); [3:1–24](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:1-1Chr3:24); and [Genesis 49:8–12](https://ref.ly/Gen49:8-Gen49:12); [Matthew 1:1–16](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:16); [Luke 3:23–34](https://ref.ly/Luke3:23-Luke3:34)).

Judah was the fourth son of Jacob's twelve sons ([Genesis 35:23](https://ref.ly/Gen35:23); [1 Chronicles 2:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1)). Leah was happy to have her fourth son. She named him Judah, which means "praise" ([Genesis 29:35](https://ref.ly/Gen29:35)). 

Judah had five sons: 

1. Er
2. Onan
3. Shelah
4. Perez
5. Zerah

Bathshua, a woman from Canaan, was the mother of Er, Onan, and Shelah ([Genesis 38:1–5](https://ref.ly/Gen38:1-Gen38:5); [1 Chronicles 2:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:3)). Perez and Zereh were twins. Tamar, Judah's daughter\-in\-law, was their mother ([Genesis 38:27–30](https://ref.ly/Gen38:27-Gen38:30); [1 Chronicles 2:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:4)).

God killed Judah's first two sons, Er and Onan, in Canaan because of their disobedience ([Genesis 46:12](https://ref.ly/Gen46:12)). Judah later moved his family to Egypt with his father and brothers ([Exodus 1:1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1-Exod1:2)).

Judah acted recklessly with Tamar but he took responsibility for Benjamin's safety in Egypt ([Genesis 38:6–30](https://ref.ly/Gen38:6-Gen38:30)). He also interceded with Joseph for his brothers ([Genesis 44:14–34](https://ref.ly/Gen44:14-Gen44:34)). When Jacob gave his dying blessing, he granted Judah a leadership role. Future kings of Israel would come from Judah's descendants (see [Genesis 49:10](https://ref.ly/Gen49:10)).
