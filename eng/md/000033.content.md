## Esau (id: 500460)

Esau was the son of Isaac and Rebekah and Jacob's older twin brother ([Genesis 25:24–26](https://ref.ly/Gen25:24-Gen25:26)). He was named Esau because he was hairy at birth. His descendants became known as Edomites. "Edom" means "red," referring to: 

* Esau's reddish color at birth ([Genesis 25:25](https://ref.ly/Gen25:25))
* The red lentil stew he got from Jacob ([Genesis 25:30](https://ref.ly/Gen25:30))
* The reddish color of the land where he settled (see study note on Genesis 25:25)

Esau was a skilled hunter who brought flavorful wild meat to his father. Isaac preferred its strong taste over the mild meat Jacob provided from the family flocks. One day, Esau came home very hungry after an unsuccessful hunt. Jacob convinced Esau to give up his rights and privileges of being firstborn in exchange for food ([Genesis 25:29–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:29-Gen25:34)). Esau did not value his birthright and was driven by his physical desires (see [Hebrews 12:16](https://ref.ly/Heb12:16)).

 He also married two local women who were not descendants of Abraham ([Genesis 26:34–35](https://ref.ly/Gen26:34-Gen26:35)). This may have influenced Rebekah's favoritism toward Jacob and her plan to take Isaac's blessing meant for Esau ([Genesis 27:1–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40)). Esau's anger upon discovering his brother's deception caused Jacob to flee to Haran. The brothers reunited twenty years later when Esau showed gracious forgiveness ([Genesis 33:1–16](https://ref.ly/Gen33:1-Gen33:16)).

Esau was born with Jacob holding his heel. People saw this as a sign that Esau's descendants would serve Jacob's descendants. The Edomites began serving the Israelites during David's time ([2 Samuel 8:11–15](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:11-2Sam8:15); [1 Chronicles 18:11–13](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:11-1Chr18:13)) and continued until Jehoram's reign ([2 Kings 8:20–22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:20-2Kgs8:22); [2 Chronicles 21:8–10](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:8-2Chr21:10)). After a rebellion in 845 BC, the Edomites briefly gained independence but were conquered again by Amaziah, who ruled from 796 to 767 BC. They regained their freedom in 735 BC and stayed independent from Judah.

In the New Testament, Esau symbolizes Abraham's descendants who did not have faith and were rejected by God for his promised blessings (see [Romans 9:6–24](https://ref.ly/Rom9:6-Rom9:24)). Herod the Great was an Edomite.
