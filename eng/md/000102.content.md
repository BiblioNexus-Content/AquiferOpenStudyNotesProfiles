## Sarah (id: 500455)

Sarah was both Abraham's wife and half\-sister ([Genesis 11:29](https://ref.ly/Gen11:29); [20:12](https://ref.ly/Gen20:12)). She traveled with Abraham from Ur to Haran and then to Canaan ([Genesis 11:31](https://ref.ly/Gen11:31); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Gen12:5)). Twice, in Egypt and Gerar, Abraham asked Sarah to claim she was his sister, not his wife ([Genesis 12:10–20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20); [20:1–18](https://ref.ly/Gen20:1-Gen20:18)). He feared he might be killed because of her. Despite Abraham's lack of faith, God protected Sarah both times. This preserved the chosen line through which God promised to grow the Israelite nation ([Genesis 12:2](https://ref.ly/Gen12:2); [17:19](https://ref.ly/Gen17:19)).

Sarah is one of several women in the Bible who could not have children but miraculously had a son (see also [Genesis 30:22–24](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:24); [1 Samuel 1:9–20](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:9-1Sam1:20); [2 Kings 4:14–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:14-2Kgs4:17); [Luke 1:5–25](https://ref.ly/Luke1:5-Luke1:25)). After God made several promises, Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to Isaac. Sarah was ninety years old when this happened, showing God's power to do what seems impossible (compare [Genesis 17:17](https://ref.ly/Gen17:17); [21:1–5](https://ref.ly/Gen21:1-Gen21:5)). Her name changed from Sarai to Sarah when God promised Isaac's birth ([Genesis 17:15–16](https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:16)). Sarah is honored for her faith, even though she laughed at the prediction of Isaac's birth ([Genesis 18:10–15](https://ref.ly/Gen18:10-Gen18:15)). This happened twenty\-five years after God's first promise to Abraham.

Sarah died at age 127 and was buried in the cave Abraham bought at Machpelah ([Genesis 23](https://ref.ly/Gen23:1-Gen23:20)). She is known as the mother of the nation of Israel ([Isaiah 51:2](https://ref.ly/Isa51:2)), just as Abraham is its father. She plays a key role in stories about Abraham’s faith (see [Romans 4:19](https://ref.ly/Rom4:19)). She symbolizes the freedom Christians have (as children of Sarah, the free woman) through faith in Christ (see [Galatians 4:21–31](https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31)). Peter uses her as an example of holy submission ([1 Peter 3:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:5-1Pet3:6)). The writer of Hebrews presents Sarah as an example of faith, for she believed in God’s ability to keep his promises ([Hebrews 11:11–12](https://ref.ly/Heb11:11-Heb11:12)). Her life shows that God is faithful, even if his timing does not always match our expectations.
