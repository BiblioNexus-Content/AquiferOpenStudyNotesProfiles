## Adam and Eve (id: 500450)

Adam was the first man and the father of humanity. God created the first couple in his image to fill the earth and manage creation ([Genesis 1:26–31](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:31)). God made Adam from the earth and gave him life ([Genesis 2:7](https://ref.ly/Gen2:7)). Adam's tasks included: 

* Tending the garden where God placed him ([Genesis 2:15](https://ref.ly/Gen2:15))
* Naming the animals ([Genesis 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Gen2:19-Gen2:20))
* Following God's instructions ([Genesis 1:28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28); [2:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:16-Gen2:17))

God created the first woman to be Adam's companion and helper ([Genesis 2:18–22](https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:22)). Eve's creation from Adam's rib shows the unity God wanted for marriage ([Genesis 2:23–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:23-Gen2:25)). She is honored as "the mother of all the living" ([Genesis 3:20](https://ref.ly/Gen3:20)).

After the serpent tricked Eve into rejecting God's rule, Adam also rebelled ([Genesis 3:1–6](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:6)). Their deliberate disobedience damaged their relationship ([Genesis 3:7](https://ref.ly/Gen3:7)). Their disobedience also separated them from God. God looked for Adam after his rebellion. He and Eve were hiding among the trees, already feeling the separation ([Genesis 3:8](https://ref.ly/Gen3:8)). 

When God questioned him, Adam blamed Eve and indirectly blamed God ([Genesis 3:12](https://ref.ly/Gen3:12)). Their rebellion led to pain, strained relationships, difficulty in managing the earth, and both physical and spiritual death ([Genesis 3:16–19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:16-Gen3:19), [22–24](https://ref.ly/Gen3:22-Gen3:24)). Despite this, God provided animal skins to cover Adam and Eve ([Genesis 3:21](https://ref.ly/Gen3:21)). God promised that Eve's descendants would defeat Satan ([Genesis 3:15](https://ref.ly/Gen3:15); see [Romans 16:20](https://ref.ly/Rom16:20); [Revelation 12:1–9](https://ref.ly/Rev12:1-Rev12:9); [20:1–10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:1-Rev20:10)).

Adam was a historical person ([Genesis 4:25](https://ref.ly/Gen4:25); [5:1–5](https://ref.ly/Gen5:1-Gen5:5); [1 Chronicles 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:1); [Hosea 6:7](https://ref.ly/Hos6:7); [Luke 3:38](https://ref.ly/Luke3:38); [Romans 5:14](https://ref.ly/Rom5:14); [1 Corinthians 15:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:22), [45](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:45); [1 Timothy 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:13-1Tim2:14); [Jude 1:14](https://ref.ly/Jude1:14)). Adam also symbolizes all of humanity. God's commands in [Genesis 1:26–30](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:30) and curses in [3:16–19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:16-Gen3:19) affected not only Adam and Eve but everyone. Adam represents the separation from God that all people experience.

The apostle Paul compared people represented by Adam, the first man, with those who follow Jesus Christ, the "last Adam" ([Romans 5:12–21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:21); [1 Corinthians 15:45–50](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:45-1Cor15:50); see also [Romans 8:5–11](https://ref.ly/Rom8:5-Rom8:11), [20–22](https://ref.ly/Rom8:20-Rom8:22)). People represented by Adam live like him. They share in his sin, separation from God and creation, and spiritual death. In contrast, those who follow Jesus live by faith in him. They are remade in Christ’s image and become "new people" who share in a new creation (see [Romans 8:29](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29); [1 Corinthians 15:49](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:49); [2 Corinthians 5:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:17); [Galatians 6:15](https://ref.ly/Gal6:15)). Jesus removes the barriers that Adam and Eve created ([Romans 5:1](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1); [2 Corinthians 5:19](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19); [Galatians 3:27–28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:27-Gal3:28); [Ephesians 2:14–16](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:16)). Jesus restores what they lost.
