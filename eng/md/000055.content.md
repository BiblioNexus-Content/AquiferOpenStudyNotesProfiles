## Jeroboam II (id: 500505)

Jeroboam II was the son of Jehoash. He ruled as king of Israel for 41 years, from 793 to 753 BC. His time as king was longer than any other northern king. He followed the bad example of Jeroboam I ([2 Kings 14:23–24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:23-2Kgs14:24)). Jeroboam II was not a relative of Jeroboam I, but they had the same name. 

During his time, the northern kingdom reached its largest size and greatest wealth since Solomon. Archaeological evidence from Jeroboam’s capital, Samaria, shows the wealth of Israel’s royal house during his reign. One reason for Israel’s new prosperity was Assyria's decline in power, which allowed the northern kingdom to grow. The prophet Jonah predicted this prosperity as God's promise ([2 Kings 14:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:25)). Even after 150 years of turning away from God in the northern kingdom, God showed his faithful love by offering Israel his mercy ([2 Kings 14:26–27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:26-2Kgs14:27)).

During Jeroboam II's reign, wealth increased, but justice did not. Rich landowners oppressed poorer ones, forcing them to leave their farms for cities. Government corruption, economic depression, and political weakness grew, while Israel's spiritual state worsened. God sent prophets to challenge Israel's leaders and people. Amos and Hosea spoke against the widespread corruption. Amos strongly criticized the rich for oppressing the poor. He warned of Jeroboam's upcoming death and Israel's punishment ([Amos 7:10–17](https://ref.ly/Amos7:10-Amos7:17)).

After Jeroboam II died, the northern kingdom quickly declined. Between 753 and 722 BC, six kings ruled one after another, and most were assassinated. In 722 BC, about 30 years after Jeroboam II's reign ended, Assyria destroyed the northern kingdom and deported its people. This action was seen as a judgment on the sins of Jeroboam II and other northern kings.
