## Barnabas (id: 500554)

Barnabas is shown in Acts as a good example of a Christian leader. He was from Cyprus and was active in the Jerusalem church. Barnabas showed great generosity by helping poorer members ([Acts 4:32–37](https://ref.ly/Acts4:32-Acts4:37)). His real name was Joseph, but he was nicknamed Barnabas. Barnabas means "Son of Encouragement" and shows his character ([Acts 4:36](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36)). 

Barnabas was well\-suited to fairly assess the new work in Antioch ([Acts 11:19–22](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:22)). Barnabas saw God's blessing there and encouraged believers to remain faithful to the Lord ([Acts 11:23](https://ref.ly/Acts11:23)). His good character was evident in his kindness, strong faith, and Spirit\-filled life and work ([Acts 11:24](https://ref.ly/Acts11:24)). The Holy Spirit chose Barnabas and Saul for a special mission (known as the first missionary journey). The church at Antioch sent them out on this journey ([Acts 13:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:3)).

Barnabas showed wisdom when he went to Tarsus to find Saul ([Acts 11:25](https://ref.ly/Acts11:25)). Barnabas admired Saul's bold preaching as a new Christian in Damascus. He introduced Saul to the apostles, which was important because Saul had previously attacked believers. Thanks to Barnabas, Saul met the original apostles, gained their acceptance, and preached bravely in Jerusalem until he had to leave ([Acts 9:26–30](https://ref.ly/Acts9:26-Acts9:30)). Barnabas's trip was successful, and for a year, they worked together in the Antioch church, attracting large crowds ([Acts 11:26](https://ref.ly/Acts11:26)).

Barnabas was an important person. In Lystra, people even thought he was Zeus (see [Acts 14:8–18](https://ref.ly/Acts14:8-Acts14:18)). He was John Mark’s cousin and mentor. Barnabas helped John Mark get a second chance to succeed as a Christian leader after he left an earlier mission (see [Acts 15:36–40](https://ref.ly/Acts15:36-Acts15:40)).

Barnabas understood how others could influence people to do wrong things. One time, he gave in to this pressure and did something he knew was wrong ([Galatians 2:11–13](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:13)). Barnabas was not perfect, but he was a "Son of Encouragement" to many. He was generous and unselfish, helping others and the church grow.
