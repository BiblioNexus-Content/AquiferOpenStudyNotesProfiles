## Elijah (id: 500502)

Elijah from Tishbe was a prophet in Israel during the reigns of Ahab and Ahaziah, from 874 to 852 BC. His name means “my God is Yahweh.” He showed that the Lord is the one true God and urged Israel to return to the Lord.

Under Ahab and Jezebel, Israel started worshiping Baal, a Canaanite god of fertility, storms, and rain. As a result, God sent a drought to Israel ([1 Kings 17:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:1)). Elijah hid until the drought ended, and God took care of him. During this time, he stayed with a widow in Zarephath, a town in Jezebel’s home region of Sidon. The widow’s son died, but Elijah prayed for him, and he came back to life ([1 Kings 17:8–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:8-1Kgs17:24)).

In the third year of drought, Elijah challenged Baal's prophets to a contest on Mount Carmel to show who the true God was ([1 Kings 18:1–40](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:1-1Kgs18:40)). The prophets of Baal called on Baal without success, becoming frantic to make him appear, while Elijah mocked Baal. When it was Elijah's turn, he poured water over his sacrifice and prayed a simple, powerful prayer. Fire immediately consumed the offering. In response, the people of Israel worshiped the Lord and, following Elijah's direction, killed Baal's prophets. Then Elijah prayed for rain, and the drought ended ([1 Kings 18:41–46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:41-1Kgs18:46)).

Despite God's great power, Ahab and Jezebel continued to mislead Israel. Jezebel was angry because her prophets were killed ([1 Kings 19:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:1-1Kgs19:2)). She threatened Elijah, who escaped to the desert and asked God to end his life. Instead, an angel fed him until he reached Mount Sinai. Elijah complained that he was the only prophet left and that his life was in danger. God encouraged him with a gentle voice, shared good news, and sent him back to serve ([1 Kings 19:3–18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:3-1Kgs19:18)).

Elijah was very dedicated to the true God. He trained an assistant named Elisha. At the end of Elijah's life on Earth, he did not die but was taken to heaven in a chariot of fire ([2 Kings 2:11–12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:11-2Kgs2:12)). Elisha took on Elijah's role as a prophet and continued to challenge false worship in Israel (see [2 Kings 2:1–9:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:1-2Kgs9:13); [13:14–25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:14-2Kgs13:25)).

The Old Testament ends with the hope that Elijah will return before the day of the Lord ([Malachi 4:5–6](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5-Mal4:6)). John the Baptist partly fulfilled this expectation (see [Matthew 11:7–14](https://ref.ly/Matt11:7-Matt11:14); [17:10–13](https://ref.ly/Matt17:10-Matt17:13); [Luke 1:17](https://ref.ly/Luke1:17)). Elijah appeared with Moses during Jesus' transfiguration (when Jesus's appearance changed to show his divine glory; [Matthew 17:1–9](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:9)). In [Revelation 11:3–12](https://ref.ly/Rev11:3-Rev11:12), one of the two witnesses seems to be either Elijah himself or someone like him. Elijah’s life shows God’s kindness and the power of prayer ([Luke 4:25–26](https://ref.ly/Luke4:25-Luke4:26); [Romans 11:2–6](https://ref.ly/Rom11:2-Rom11:6); [James 5:17–18](https://ref.ly/Jas5:17-Jas5:18)).
