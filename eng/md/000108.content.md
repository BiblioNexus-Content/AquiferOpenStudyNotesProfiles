## The Amalekites (id: 500488)

The Amalekites were the descendants of Amalek, a grandson of Esau ([Genesis 36:12](https://ref.ly/Gen36:12); [1 Chronicles 1:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:36)). They were nomadic herdsmen. Their territory in the Negev stretched from south of Beersheba to the southeast, reaching Elath and Ezion\-geber. They likely raided west into the coastal plain, east into the Arabah wastelands, and possibly into Arabia.

The Amalekites were strong enemies of Israel. Israel first met the Amalekite warriors at Rephidim near Sinai when they attacked Israel ([Exodus 17:8–16](https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:16)). Joshua and the Israelite army defeated the Amalekites in this battle. Later, the Amalekites stopped Israel's disobedient attempt to enter the promised land ([Numbers 14:39–45](https://ref.ly/Num14:39-Num14:45)). 

Because of their hostility, Moses told Israel to destroy them ([Deuteronomy 25:17–19](https://ref.ly/Deut25:17-Deut25:19)). But the Amalekites continued to live in the Negev (see [Judges 3:12–14](https://ref.ly/Judg3:12-Judg3:14); [6:33](https://ref.ly/Judg6:33); [1 Samuel 14:47–48](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:47-1Sam14:48); [15:1–35](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:1-1Sam15:35)). Those who survived remained enemies of Israel ([1 Samuel 27:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8); [30:1–20](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:1-1Sam30:20); [2 Samuel 8:11–12](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:11-2Sam8:12); [Psalm 83:1–8](https://ref.ly/Ps83:1-Ps83:8)). This remaining group was finally destroyed during King Hezekiah's reign ([1 Chronicles 4:42–43](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:42-1Chr4:43)). In the book of Esther, Haman, a descendant of King Agag, showed their hostility to the very end ([Esther 3](https://ref.ly/Esth3:1-Esth3:15); see [1 Samuel 15](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:1-1Sam15:35)).
