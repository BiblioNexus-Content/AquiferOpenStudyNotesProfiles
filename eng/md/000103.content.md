## Satan (id: 500521)

The book of Job mentions "the satan" as part of the heavenly court ([Job 1:6](https://ref.ly/Job1:6); [2:1](https://ref.ly/Job2:1)). (The heavenly court is a gathering in heaven where God meets with his angels.) In Hebrew, *satan* means an adversary or accuser in court (see [Job 1–2](https://ref.ly/Job1:1-Job2:13); [Zechariah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Zech3:1)). God sometimes uses angels as adversaries for righteous judgment and to oppose wrongdoers (for example, [Numbers 22:22](https://ref.ly/Num22:22), [32](https://ref.ly/Num22:32), where *satan* is often translated as "oppose"; see also [1 Kings 22:19–23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:19-1Kgs22:23)). 

The Old Testament suggests the accuser has a demonic nature. But it was in the time between the Old and New Testaments that Satan became associated with the serpent in Eden (see *Wisdom of Solomon* 2:24\). The New Testament calls the chief demon "Satan" ([Revelation 20:2](https://ref.ly/Rev20:2)). The New Testament uses other names like: 

* The devil ([Matthew 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11))
* The tempter ([1 Thessalonians 3:5](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:5))
* Beelzebul, the prince of demons (see notes at [Matthew 12:24](https://ref.ly/Matt12:24); [Luke 11:15](https://ref.ly/Luke11:15))
* The evil one ([Matthew 13:19](https://ref.ly/Matt13:19), [38](https://ref.ly/Matt13:38); [1 John 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/1John2:13-1John2:14); [3:12](https://ref.ly/1John3:12); [5:18](https://ref.ly/1John5:18))
* Belial (see note at [2 Corinthians 6:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:15))
* The deceiver ([Revelation 12:9](https://ref.ly/Rev12:9))
* A huge red dragon with seven heads ([Revelation 12:3](https://ref.ly/Rev12:3), [9](https://ref.ly/Rev12:9))
* Ancient serpent ([Revelation 20:2](https://ref.ly/Rev20:2))
* A murderer and the father of lies ([John 8:44](https://ref.ly/John8:44))

Satan did many evil things against God and people. He made David count his army when he should not have ([1 Chronicles 21:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:1); compare [2 Samuel 24:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:1)). Satan tried to tempt Jesus to do wrong and later helped Judas betray Jesus ([Mark 1:12–13](https://ref.ly/Mark1:12-Mark1:13); [John 13:27](https://ref.ly/John13:27)). He wanted to test Peter's faith like he tested Job ([Luke 22:31](https://ref.ly/Luke22:31)). He trapped people in sin ([Acts 26:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:17-Acts26:18)). He used lies to oppose God's people ([1 Corinthians 7:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:5); [2 Corinthians 11:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:14)). In the end, God will defeat and imprison Satan, overcoming the adversary of God's people ([Revelation 12:9](https://ref.ly/Rev12:9); [20:2](https://ref.ly/Rev20:2), [10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10)).
