## Elisha (id: 500504)

Elisha the prophet followed and succeeded Elijah in the northern kingdom of Israel during the late 800s BC. At that time, the leaders and people of the northern kingdom turned away from God and worshiped the Canaanite god Baal. Ahab and Jezebel were devoted worshipers of this false god, as were their descendants who followed them on the throne. Elisha's ministry lasted from 853 to 798 BC. It began as King Ahab's reign was ending. He played a key role in God's plan to remove Israel's idol\-worshiping leaders.

Elisha began his work as a follower of Elijah and was chosen by God to replace him ([1 Kings 19:15–21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:15-1Kgs19:21); [2 Kings 2:1–18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:1-2Kgs2:18)). After Elijah went up to heaven, Elisha's miracles showed that God's great power was with him.

Elisha’s miracles often involved water. He made the bad water of a spring near Jericho clean and made an ax head float ([2 Kings 2:19–22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:19-2Kgs2:22); [6:1–7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:1-2Kgs6:7)). When King Joram ran out of water in enemy territory, Elisha accurately predicted that plenty of water would appear ([2 Kings 3:4–20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:4-2Kgs3:20)). People believed Baal controlled water, so these miracles showed that the Lord, not Baal, was truly in control.

Elisha showed God's power by helping people in real ways. He helped a poor woman by miraculously filling her jars with olive oil ([2 Kings 4:1–7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:1-2Kgs4:7)). He told a woman from Shunem she would have a son and later brought her son back to life ([2 Kings 4:8–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:8-2Kgs4:37)). He healed an Aramean general named Naaman of leprosy ([2 Kings 5:1–19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:1-2Kgs5:19)). He also provided food for those in need ([2 Kings 4:38–44](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:38-2Kgs4:44)).

Elisha played a role in God's plan to judge the northern kingdom. He anointed Jehu of Israel and Hazael of Aram ([2 Kings 8:7–15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:7-2Kgs8:15); [9:1–13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:1-2Kgs9:13)). He poured sacred oil on their heads to show God had chosen them. They violently ended the rule of Israel's leaders who promoted Baal worship (see [1 Kings 19:15–18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:15-1Kgs19:18)).

Elisha's miracles foreshadowed Jesus' work because Jesus: 

* Healed people with leprosy ([Matthew 8:1–4](https://ref.ly/Matt8:1-Matt8:4))
* Brought the dead back to life ([Mark 5:21–43](https://ref.ly/Mark5:21-Mark5:43); [Luke 7:11–17](https://ref.ly/Luke7:11-Luke7:17); [John 11:1–44](https://ref.ly/John11:1-John11:44))
* Provided food in miraculous ways ([Matthew 14:13–21](https://ref.ly/Matt14:13-Matt14:21); [15:32–38](https://ref.ly/Matt15:32-Matt15:38))

Jesus spoke about healing Naaman to show that God's mercy extends beyond Israelites to gentiles ([Luke 4:27](https://ref.ly/Luke4:27)).
