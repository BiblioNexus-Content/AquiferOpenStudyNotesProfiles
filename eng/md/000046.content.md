## Isaac (id: 500457)

The name Isaac means "he laughs," which reflects how he was born. When God promised Isaac's birth, both Abraham and Sarah laughed in disbelief ([Genesis 17:15–19](https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:19); [18:9–15](https://ref.ly/Gen18:9-Gen18:15)). God had promised Abraham a son ([Genesis 15:4–6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:4-Gen15:6)). But, no son had come, and Abraham and Sarah were too old to have children. So, when Isaac was born, they laughed with joy ([Genesis 21:6–7](https://ref.ly/Gen21:6-Gen21:7)).

When Isaac was a teenager, God tested Abraham by telling him to sacrifice Isaac ([Genesis 22:1–19](https://ref.ly/Gen22:1-Gen22:19)). Abraham's faith stayed strong. He obeyed and Isaac submitted to his. God then intervened and provided a ram to sacrifice instead of Isaac. Because of Abraham's faith, God promised him great blessings ([Genesis 22:15–18](https://ref.ly/Gen22:15-Gen22:18)).

Isaac married Rebekah and was ready to continue the chosen family line, but Rebekah could not have children ([Genesis 25:21](https://ref.ly/Gen25:21)). Instead of trying to solve problems by himself as his father had done (see [Genesis 16:1–16](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:16)), Isaac prayed to the Lord, and Rebekah gave birth to twin sons. Isaac preferred Esau, the older son, while Rebekah preferred Jacob. This favoritism led to Jacob deceiving Isaac when he was old and blind ([Genesis 27:1–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40)). Favoritism continued to be an issue among Isaac’s descendants (see [Genesis 29:30](https://ref.ly/Gen29:30); [33:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen33:1-Gen33:2); [37:4](https://ref.ly/Gen37:4)).

Isaac followed his father Abraham's example in dealing with nearby nations. During a famine, he visited another kingdom and, out of fear, said his wife was his sister ([Genesis 26:1–11](https://ref.ly/Gen26:1-Gen26:11); compare [12:10–20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20); [20:1–18](https://ref.ly/Gen20:1-Gen20:18)). Like his father, Isaac became wealthy in that land and was asked to leave ([Genesis 26:12–16](https://ref.ly/Gen26:12-Gen26:16); compare [12:16–20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:16-Gen12:20)). He faced disputes over water and land with other herdsmen ([Genesis 26:17–22](https://ref.ly/Gen26:17-Gen26:22); compare [21:25–31](https://ref.ly/Gen21:25-Gen21:31)). He also made a treaty with the king of the Philistines ([Genesis 26:26–31](https://ref.ly/Gen26:26-Gen26:31); compare [21:22–32](https://ref.ly/Gen21:22-Gen21:32)).

Isaac received the same promise as his father ([Genesis 26:2–5](https://ref.ly/Gen26:2-Gen26:5), [23–25](https://ref.ly/Gen26:23-Gen26:25); compare [22:16–18](https://ref.ly/Gen22:16-Gen22:18)). He showed his commitment by continuing the practice of circumcision, which symbolized the covenant (see [Acts 7:8](https://ref.ly/Acts7:8)). As the child of promise, Isaac represents all who are Abraham's children through faith in Christ. They are free to live as God's children, not as slaves (see [Galatians 4:21–5:1](https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal5:1)).
