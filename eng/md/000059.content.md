## Joab (id: 500495)

Joab was David's nephew and the son of David's sister Zeruiah ([1 Chronicles 2:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:13-1Chr2:16)). His brothers were Abishai and Asahel. Joab became the commander of David's armies due to his bravery and military skill ([2 Samuel 2:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:18); [8:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:16); [11:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1); [1 Chronicles 18:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:15)). He earned the commander's position by being the first to attack the Jebusite city of Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 11:4–9](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:4-1Chr11:9)). Joab also stopped a rebellion among the Arameans and Ammonites ([2 Samuel 10:1–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:19); [1 Chronicles 19:8–15](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:8-1Chr19:15)). He won many important battles for David against the northern army of Israel, which was under Abner's strong leadership ([2 Samuel 2:12–32](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:12-2Sam2:32)).

Joab often acted to support what he thought were David's interests. For example, he worked with David in the death of Uriah the Hittite to hide the king's adultery with Bathsheba ([2 Samuel 11:1–27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27)). He convinced David to let Absalom return to court ([14:1–33](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:1-2Sam14:33)). He also tried to stop David from taking a census that made God angry ([2 Samuel 24:1–9](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:1-2Sam24:9); [1 Chronicles 21:1–6](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:1-1Chr21:6)).

Joab was loyal to David but sometimes acted for himself and ignored the king's orders. When Abner killed Joab's brother Asahel ([2 Samuel 2:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:23)), Joab took revenge by killing Abner ([2 Samuel 3:26–30](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:26-2Sam3:30)), even though Abner had become loyal to David ([2 Samuel 3:12–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:12-2Sam3:19)). Later, Joab killed his cousin Amasa, who had led Absalom's army ([2 Samuel 20:8–10](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:8-2Sam20:10); [17:25](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:25)). This happened after David made Amasa the commander instead of Joab ([2 Samuel 19:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:13); [20:4](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:4)). 

Joab also killed Absalom against David's direct order ([2 Samuel 18:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:5), [10–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:10-2Sam18:17)). He then criticized David for mourning Absalom's death instead of praising the army ([2 Samuel 19:5–7](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:5-2Sam19:7)). Joab was ruthless and regained the top position in David's army ([2 Samuel 20:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:23); [24:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:2); [1 Kings 1:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:19)).

Joab's decision to support Adonijah's claim to the throne led to his death ([1 Kings 1:5–7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:5-1Kgs1:7)). Near the end of his life, David ordered Solomon to put Joab to death for killing Abner and Amasa. After becoming king, Solomon ordered Benaiah to kill Joab. Joab ran to the altar and grabbed its horns (corners) for protection ([1 Kings 2:28–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:34)). Joab faced the same end he had given others, and his executioner became the new commander of Israel's army ([1 Kings 2:35](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:35)).
