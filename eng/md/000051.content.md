## James, Son of Zebedee (id: 500545)

James, son of Zebedee and brother of John, was one of the twelve apostles. He was among the first to die as a follower of Jesus. His mother might have been the sister of Mary, Jesus' mother, making him Jesus' cousin (see [Matthew 27:56](https://ref.ly/Matt27:56); [Mark 15:40](https://ref.ly/Mark15:40); [16:1](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1); [John 19:25](https://ref.ly/John19:25)). His name usually appears before John's, which might mean James was older. This James was not James, son of Alphaeus (see [Luke 6:15](https://ref.ly/Luke6:15)) or James, brother of Jesus.

James and John were fishermen like their father ([Matthew 4:21](https://ref.ly/Matt4:21); [Mark 1:19](https://ref.ly/Mark1:19)). They fished with Peter and Andrew, another pair of brothers who became disciples ([Luke 5:10](https://ref.ly/Luke5:10)). They were among the first people Jesus called to be his disciples. They left everything, including their father, to follow him ([Matthew 4:22](https://ref.ly/Matt4:22); [Mark 1:20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:20); [Luke 5:11](https://ref.ly/Luke5:11)). Jesus called them “Sons of Thunder” ([Mark 3:17](https://ref.ly/Mark3:17)). This might mean they had strong personalities (see [Luke 9:54](https://ref.ly/Luke9:54)), though the exact meaning is unclear.

James and his brother John were very close to Jesus. Along with Peter, they formed a trusted group of disciples who joined Jesus on special occasions. They were with him when he healed Jairus's daughter ([Mark 5:37](https://ref.ly/Mark5:37); [Luke 8:51](https://ref.ly/Luke8:51)), talked with Elijah and Moses on a mountain ([Matthew 17:1–3](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:3); [Mark 9:2–4](https://ref.ly/Mark9:2-Mark9:4); [Luke 9:28–30](https://ref.ly/Luke9:28-Luke9:30)), and prayed in the garden ([Matthew 26:37](https://ref.ly/Matt26:37); [Mark 14:33](https://ref.ly/Mark14:33)). At one time, the two brothers upset the other disciples by asking for special positions in the coming kingdom of God ([Matthew 20:20–28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:20-Matt20:28); [Mark 10:35–45](https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:45); compare [Luke 22:24–27](https://ref.ly/Luke22:24-Luke22:27)).

Herod Agrippa had James killed soon after Jesus' death, which pleased the Jewish leaders ([Acts 12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts12:1-Acts12:3)). Herod might have done this because James was an important leader among the disciples. This event fulfilled Jesus' prediction that James would share in his suffering ([Matt 20:23](https://ref.ly/Matt20:23); [Mark 10:38–39](https://ref.ly/Mark10:38-Mark10:39)).

James was an ordinary worker whom Jesus called to be his disciple. He left his job, family, and home to follow Jesus with simple trust. Eventually, he died for Jesus, making him a model of committed discipleship.
