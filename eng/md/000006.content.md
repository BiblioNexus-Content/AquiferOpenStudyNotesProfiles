## Absalom (id: 500496)

Absalom was the son of King David. The Bible says Absalom was "handsome and highly praised" ([2 Samuel 14:25–26](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:25-2Sam14:26)). When his sister Tamar was raped and abandoned by their half\-brother Amnon, Absalom provided care and protection for her ([2 Samuel 13:1–20](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:1-2Sam13:20)). He might have expected David to punish Amnon, but David did nothing ([2 Samuel 13:21](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:21)). For two years, Absalom's anger and hatred increased ([2 Samuel 13:22](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:22)). Then he murdered Amnon and fled to his grandfather, King Talmai of Geshur ([2 Samuel 13:23–39](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:23-2Sam13:39)).

After three years, Joab convinced David to bring Absalom back. However, David neither punished nor reconciled with him. Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years with privilege but felt isolated. Then he insisted on seeing the king. They met and appeared to reconcile ([2 Samuel 14:28–33](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:28-2Sam14:33)). 

For Absalom, this meeting might have been a step toward the throne. Afterward, he started a campaign to weaken the people's trust in David ([2 Samuel 15:1–6](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:1-2Sam15:6)). Eventually, Absalom's deceitful ways succeeded. He started a rebellion and gathered supporters in Hebron from all over Israel. By the time David heard about what Absalom was doing, he could only flee Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 15:13–37](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:13-2Sam15:37); see [Psalm 3](https://ref.ly/Ps3:1-Ps3:8)).

David's wisest adviser was Ahithophel. When Absalom arrived in Jerusalem, Ahithophel joined Absalom and advised a quick attack while David was weak. However, Hushai, David's secret agent, suggested gathering more troops and attacking with overwhelming force. This advice appealed to Absalom's ego, but it was a fatal mistake. Both advisers knew it was wrong to give experienced warriors like David and his men time to gather strength, scout, and plan. 

By the time Absalom led his forces across the Jordan River to fight in the forest of Ephraim, David and his loyal forces were well\-rested and led by the capable Joab, Abishai, and Ittai from Gath. David's men outmaneuvered Absalom's larger forces and defeated them. Absalom fled on a mule, but his long hair got caught in a tree. Joab and his men found Absalom hanging helplessly and killed him, despite David's order to show him mercy ([2 Samuel 18:1–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:18)).

Absalom's death shocked David, and his grief almost pushed away those who risked their lives to stop Absalom's rebellion against the kingdom ([2 Samuel 18:33–19:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:33-2Sam19:8)). Absalom had reasons to be unhappy with David's rule. However, instead of following his father's example of trusting in the Lord and respecting the anointed king, Absalom started a rebellion that led to his own death ([1 Samuel 24:5–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam24:5-1Sam24:11); [26:5–24](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:5-1Sam26:24)).
