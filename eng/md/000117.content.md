## Thomas (id: 500553)

Thomas was one of the twelve apostles ([Matthew 10:3](https://ref.ly/Matt10:3); [Mark 3:18](https://ref.ly/Mark3:18); [Luke 6:15](https://ref.ly/Luke6:15); [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13)). He is also known as "the Twin." People remember him most for doubting that Jesus had risen from death.

We do not know how Jesus first met and called Thomas to be his disciple. The Gospel of John is the only source with personal accounts of Thomas. Thomas expressed his willingness to follow Jesus, even if it meant death ([John 11:16](https://ref.ly/John11:16)). He openly told Jesus that he did not understand what he was saying ([John 14:5](https://ref.ly/John14:5)). Thomas was also one of the seven disciples who went back to fishing after the resurrection, when Jesus appeared to them ([John 21:2](https://ref.ly/John21:2)).

When Jesus first appeared to his disciples after his death, Thomas was not there. When Thomas heard the others' report, he did not believe it. He insisted he needed to see the crucifixion marks on Jesus's body and touch them himself ([John 20:19–25](https://ref.ly/John20:19-John20:25)). A week later, Jesus appeared to the disciples again and spoke directly to Thomas. He told Thomas to examine the nail and spear marks on his body and challenged him to believe, not doubt ([John 20:26–27](https://ref.ly/John20:26-John20:27)). 

When Thomas saw Jesus alive again, he made one of the most important statements in the New Testament. He acknowledged Jesus as God by saying, “My Lord and my God!” ([John 20:28](https://ref.ly/John20:28)). This moment shows most clearly in John's Gospel that Jesus is divine (God in human form).

Later traditions say Thomas worked as a missionary in the East, including Parthia (according to Eusebius), Persia (according to Jerome), and India (according to the *Acts of Thomas*). The Mar Thoma Church on India's west coast traces its origins to Thomas's early missionary work. The historical accuracy of these accounts is uncertain.

Some ancient books claim to be written by Thomas or to be about him, but these were written long after he died and are not considered reliable. These include: 

* The *Acts of Thomas*
* *T*he *Infancy Gospel of Thomas*
* *T*he *Epistle to the Apostles*
* *T*he *Apocalypse of Thomas*
* *T*he *Book of Thomas the Athlete*
* *T*he *Gospel of Thomas* (a Gnostic collection of Jesus's sayings)
