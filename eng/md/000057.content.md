## Jewish Leaders (id: 500550)

Jesus often disagreed with Jewish leaders during his public ministry. These leaders believed they were protecting the temple, its sacrifices, the synagogue, and its teachings. In Jesus' last week in Jerusalem, these arguments became more intense and helped build the case against him (see [Matthew 23](https://ref.ly/Matt23:1-Matt23:39)).

When John wrote his Gospel, local Jewish synagogues were attacking followers of Jesus in their areas. This conflict influenced John's writing (see [Acts 14:19](https://ref.ly/Acts14:19); [1 Thessalonians 2:14](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14); compare [Galatians 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Gal1:13-Gal1:14)). 

The Greek term for “Jewish leaders” could also mean “Jews.” However, it specifically referred to the temple leaders who opposed Jesus, judged him, and planned his death on the cross (see [John 1:19](https://ref.ly/John1:19); [2:18](https://ref.ly/John2:18); [5:9–18](https://ref.ly/John5:9-John5:18); [9:18–22](https://ref.ly/John9:18-John9:22)). This distinction is important because some view the New Testament, especially John’s Gospel, as prejudiced against Jewish people. However, Jesus, who was Jewish, did not oppose all Jews. His opponents were the “Jewish leaders,” the religious authorities in first\-century Jerusalem.
