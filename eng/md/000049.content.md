## Jacob (id: 500466)

Jacob was the younger twin son of Isaac and Rebekah. He struggled with his twin brother Esau in the womb and was born holding Esau’s heel ([Genesis 25:21–26](https://ref.ly/Gen25:21-Gen25:26)). God told Rebekah that the boys symbolized two nations and that the older son would serve the younger ([Genesis 25:23](https://ref.ly/Gen25:23)).

Isaac favored Esau, who loved the outdoors, while Rebekah preferred Jacob, who enjoyed staying at home. One day, Esau came back very hungry from hunting, and Jacob traded him some red stew for his inheritance rights ([Genesis 25:27–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:27-Gen25:34); see [Hebrews 12:16](https://ref.ly/Heb12:16)). Later, Isaac asked Esau to prepare wild game for him to eat so he could bless him ([Genesis 27:1–4](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:4); compare [25:28](https://ref.ly/Gen25:28)). However, Rebekah sent Jacob to trick Isaac into giving him the blessing instead, and her plan worked ([Genesis 27:5–29](https://ref.ly/Gen27:5-Gen27:29)). Jacob's deception was soon discovered ([Genesis 27:30–35](https://ref.ly/Gen27:30-Gen27:35)). But legally, valid blessings were unchangeable promises ([27:33](https://ref.ly/Gen27:33)). So Isaac gave Esau a lesser blessing ([Genesis 27:36–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:36-Gen27:40)). Esau planned to kill Jacob ([27:41](https://ref.ly/Gen27:41)). Rebekah persuaded Isaac to send Jacob to her brother Laban so Jacob could marry within the family ([Genesis 27:42–46](https://ref.ly/Gen27:42-Gen27:46)).

Isaac gave the covenant promises to Jacob and sent him to Haran ([Genesis 28:1–5](https://ref.ly/Gen28:1-Gen28:5)). On the way, God appeared to Jacob in a dream and confirmed the promises of land and descendants given to Abraham and Isaac ([Genesis 28:10–15](https://ref.ly/Gen28:10-Gen28:15)). Jacob worshiped the Lord and named the place Bethel, meaning "house of God."

In Haran, Jacob worked for his uncle Laban ([Genesis 29–31](https://ref.ly/Gen29:1-Gen31:55)). Jacob loved Laban's daughter Rachel and worked seven years to marry her. However, Laban tricked him by giving him his older daughter Leah on the wedding night. Jacob then worked another seven years for Rachel and six more years to build his own flocks ([Genesis 30:25–43](https://ref.ly/Gen30:25-Gen30:43); see also [31:38–42](https://ref.ly/Gen31:38-Gen31:42)). Despite many challenges, he had thirteen children and became very wealthy.

After twenty years, God told Jacob to return to Canaan ([Genesis 31:3](https://ref.ly/Gen31:3)). Jacob feared Laban and his sons ([Genesis 31:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen31:1-Gen31:2)). So, he organized his caravan and left while Laban was away ([31:4–21](https://ref.ly/Gen31:4-Gen31:21)). Laban chased after him, but God stopped him from harming Jacob ([Genesis 31:22–24](https://ref.ly/Gen31:22-Gen31:24), [29](https://ref.ly/Gen31:29)). Instead, Laban scolded Jacob for leaving secretly and accused him of stealing his idols ([Genesis 31:25–30](https://ref.ly/Gen31:25-Gen31:30)). Jacob allowed Laban to search his tents, but the idols were not found ([Genesis 31:33–35](https://ref.ly/Gen31:33-Gen31:35)). Jacob then became angry ([Genesis 31:36–42](https://ref.ly/Gen31:36-Gen31:42)). Although their conflict was unresolved, the two men made a peace agreement ([Genesis 31:43–54](https://ref.ly/Gen31:43-Gen31:54)). The location became a lasting boundary between Israel and Aram.

Jacob now faced Esau and God. When Esau came with four hundred men, Jacob asked for God's protection and sent gifts to make peace with his brother, whom he had not seen for many years ([Genesis 32:3–21](https://ref.ly/Gen32:3-Gen32:21)). That night, in an event symbolizing his life, Jacob wrestled with a man who dislocated his hip and gave him the blessing he wanted ([Genesis 32:22–32](https://ref.ly/Gen32:22-Gen32:32)). God also changed his name to Israel, meaning "God fights."

In the morning, Jacob met Esau, and they reconciled ([Genesis 33:1–11](https://ref.ly/Gen33:1-Gen33:11)). Esau was kind and forgiving, and Jacob shared some of his blessings. Esau then returned to Seir, while Jacob continued to Canaan. In Shechem, Jacob bought land and built an altar ([Genesis 33:18–20](https://ref.ly/Gen33:18-Gen33:20)). He then moved to Bethel and removed all foreign idols from his household ([Genesis 35:1–8](https://ref.ly/Gen35:1-Gen35:8)). God reaffirmed Jacob's new name, Israel, and renewed his promises of land and descendants ([Genesis 35:9–15](https://ref.ly/Gen35:9-Gen35:15)).

Jacob favored Rachel and her son Joseph ([Genesis 37:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen37:1-Gen37:3)). Joseph's brothers grew jealous and hated him. Joseph's dreams made them angrier ([Genesis 37:4–11](https://ref.ly/Gen37:4-Gen37:11)), so they sold him as a slave ([Genesis 37:12–28](https://ref.ly/Gen37:12-Gen37:28)). For over twenty years, Jacob thought Joseph was dead. Jacob only learned Joseph was alive after sending Benjamin to Egypt with Judah. Joseph then helped his family during the famine ([Genesis 43:1–14](https://ref.ly/Gen43:1-Gen43:14); [45:24–28](https://ref.ly/Gen45:24-Gen45:28)). Jacob felt renewed and moved to Egypt. He joyfully reunited with Joseph in Goshen ([Genesis 46:28–30](https://ref.ly/Gen46:28-Gen46:30)) and thrived for seventeen more years.

When Jacob was near death at age 147, he planned for his family's future. He made Joseph promise to bury him in Canaan ([Genesis 47:29–31](https://ref.ly/Gen47:29-Gen47:31); [49:29–32](https://ref.ly/Gen49:29-Gen49:32)). He gave Joseph’s sons his main blessing and placed Ephraim, the younger son, first ([Genesis 48:1–20](https://ref.ly/Gen48:1-Gen48:20)). He assured the family they would return to Canaan ([Genesis 48:21–22](https://ref.ly/Gen48:21-Gen48:22)). Then he blessed each of his sons and predicted the future of their descendants ([Genesis 49:1–28](https://ref.ly/Gen49:1-Gen49:28)). He died and was buried in the cave of Machpelah, accompanied by his sons and a large Egyptian procession ([Genesis 49:33–50:13](https://ref.ly/Gen49:33-Gen50:13)). His death marked the end of the patriarchal age and the start of Israel’s growth as a nation in Egypt until they returned to live in the promised land (see Exodus—Joshua).

The name "Jacob" became another name for the nation of Israel (see [Numbers 23:7](https://ref.ly/Num23:7), [21](https://ref.ly/Num23:21); [24:5](https://ref.ly/Num24:5); [Hosea 12:2](https://ref.ly/Hos12:2)). God called the nation to serve him as their ancestors did ([Hosea 12:3–14](https://ref.ly/Hos12:3-Hos12:14)). He promised Israel the same love he showed Jacob ([Malachi 1:2](https://ref.ly/Mal1:2)). He also promised that a powerful leader would come from Jacob's descendants ([Genesis 49:8–12](https://ref.ly/Gen49:8-Gen49:12); [Numbers 24:17–19](https://ref.ly/Num24:17-Num24:19)).
