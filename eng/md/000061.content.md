## John the Baptist (id: 500547)

John the Baptist was a passionate preacher who lived in the desert and called people to repent (to change their lives by stopping their wrongdoing and turning to God). He became known as "the Baptist" (or "the Baptizer") because he baptized (immersed) people in water as a sign that they were turning away from their sins. John acted like Elijah to prepare people for the Messiah's arrival ([Malachi 4:4–5](https://ref.ly/Mal4:4-Mal4:5); [Matthew 11:14](https://ref.ly/Matt11:14); [17:12](https://ref.ly/Matt17:12); [Mark 9:13](https://ref.ly/Mark9:13)).

John's birth, like Jesus', was extraordinary. John's parents were very old and unable to have children ([Luke 1:5–25](https://ref.ly/Luke1:5-Luke1:25)). His mother, Elizabeth, was a relative of Mary, Jesus' mother ([Luke 1:36](https://ref.ly/Luke1:36)). So, John was related to Jesus. These two miraculous births around the same time marked the start of God's redeeming work.

John was filled with the Holy Spirit from birth and dedicated his life to preparing people for the Lord's arrival ([Luke 1:15–17](https://ref.ly/Luke1:15-Luke1:17)). He began teaching people when he was about thirty years old while living in the desert ([Luke 1:80](https://ref.ly/Luke1:80)). He wore clothes made of camel's hair with a leather belt, similar to what ancient prophets wore, and ate desert food (locusts and wild honey, see [Matthew 3:4](https://ref.ly/Matt3:4); [Mark 1:6](https://ref.ly/Mark1:6)). John urged everyone to repent and be baptized ([Matthew 3:1–2](https://ref.ly/Matt3:1-Matt3:2); [Mark 1:4](https://ref.ly/Mark1:4); [Luke 3:1–3](https://ref.ly/Luke3:1-Luke3:3)). He even criticized the religious leaders who came to listen to him ([Matthew 3:7–10](https://ref.ly/Matt3:7-Matt3:10)).

John baptized Jesus, though at first he felt unworthy to do so ([Matthew 3:13–17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:13-Matt3:17)). John knew Jesus was greater than him. While John used water, Jesus would "baptize with the Holy Spirit" ([John 1:33](https://ref.ly/John1:33); [Matthew 3:11](https://ref.ly/Matt3:11); [Mark 1:7–8](https://ref.ly/Mark1:7-Mark1:8); [Luke 3:16](https://ref.ly/Luke3:16); compare [John 3:23–30](https://ref.ly/John3:23-John3:30)). John encouraged his followers to become Jesus' disciples. Many did, including: 

* Andrew ([John 1:35–40](https://ref.ly/John1:35-John1:40))
* Apollos ([Acts 18:24–26](https://ref.ly/Acts18:24-Acts18:26))
* The twelve disciples at Ephesus ([Acts 19:1–7](https://ref.ly/Acts19:1-Acts19:7))

John criticized Herod Antipas for marrying Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, which was against the law. To satisfy Herodias, Herod imprisoned and then executed John ([Matthew 14:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt14:3-Matt14:12); [Mark 6:17–29](https://ref.ly/Mark6:17-Mark6:29); [Luke 3:19–20](https://ref.ly/Luke3:19-Luke3:20)). John's imprisonment marked the start of Jesus' public preaching ([Matthew 4:12](https://ref.ly/Matt4:12); [Mark 1:14](https://ref.ly/Mark1:14)).

Shortly before his death, John appeared confused about Jesus. He sent messengers from prison to ask if Jesus was truly the Messiah (God's chosen one). Jesus did not do what most people expected the Messiah to do. Instead of bringing judgment and a visible kingdom, he brought forgiveness, healing, and a spiritual kingdom. To reassure John, Jesus spoke of the miraculous things God was doing through him ([Luke 7:18–23](https://ref.ly/Luke7:18-Luke7:23)).

John stayed true to his mission throughout his life. He consistently preached about repentance and God's judgment, even to those who did not want to listen. Jesus called John one of the greatest servants of God who ever lived ([Matthew 11:2–19](https://ref.ly/Matt11:2-Matt11:19); [Luke 7:18–35](https://ref.ly/Luke7:18-Luke7:35)). John was the last in a long line of prophets who predicted the coming of God's Kingdom ([Luke 16:16](https://ref.ly/Luke16:16)). He stood at the start of a new era, announcing its arrival to everyone willing to hear.
