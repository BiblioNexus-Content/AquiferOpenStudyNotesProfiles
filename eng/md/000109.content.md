## The Greeks (id: 500529)

Greek civilization was important in the ancient world. Greek culture greatly influenced the world during Jesus' birth and the writing of the New Testament.

### Mycenaean Civilization (1450 to 1200 BC)

The Mycenaeans lived during the "heroic age," between 1450 and 1200 BC. This time was called the "heroic age" because it was when many famous Greek stories about heroes and great battles took place. These stories were later written down by Homer in his long poems. Their civilization was based in Mycenae, about thirty miles south of Corinth. The Mycenaeans traded widely and were very good at warfare. The Greek gods and myths known from later writings began in Mycenaean Greece. Mycenaean documents were written in Linear B, a script using syllables.

The Mycenaean civilization ended violently around 1200 BC due to Dorian Greek invaders. The following centuries are known as the "Greek Dark Ages." During this time, people stopped using Linear B script, and there are no written records.

### Archaic Age, City\-States (850–546 BC)

Eventually, Greek towns and villages organized into city\-states that controlled large areas. During this time, Greeks began to cooperate more and shared a common identity. For example, they held the first Olympic Games in 776 BC.

As trade with nearby regions grew, the Greeks met the Phoenicians and adopted their writing system. Homer wrote the *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, which tell the stories and myths of the earlier Mycenaean civilization and their gods.

Many city\-states depended on a powerful leaders called tyrants. These leaders helped keep order and peace in their cities. (The Greek word for these rulers is *tyrannos*.) Many areas wrote down their basic laws in a document called a constitution. This helped create clear rules for governing. In Athens, a small group of powerful people called the Areopagus Council ruled the city. This type of government was called an oligarchy. Later, a leader named Solon made important changes to how Athens was governed. These changes helped Athens become a democracy, where citizens could vote and help make decisions.

### Persian Wars, Classical Period (546 to 336 BC)

In 546 BC, Cyrus the Great of Persia took control of the Greek colonies in Asia Minor. Around 500 BC, Ionia tried to revolt but failed. This led Darius I to invade the Greek mainland in 492 BC. During the following wars, the Greeks were often outnumbered but used better skill and strategy to outmaneuver the Persians. In the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, the Greeks defeated the Persians decisively. Ten years later, the Persian army under Xerxes crossed the Hellespont, and their large fleet entered Greek waters. The Persians burned Athens, but eventually, the Greeks won, and Xerxes withdrew.

After the Persian Wars ended, Athens was rebuilt and entered a period of greatness. Pericles led Athens to create a full democracy. They built large structures on the Acropolis. Athens became wealthy, and its sea power increased. This was a golden age of great achievements in art, thought, literature, and architecture.

### Macedonian Empire, Hellenistic Civilization (336–146 BC)

Philip II of Macedon wanted to build an empire. He defeated Athens and Thebes in 338 BC and united Greece under the Macedonian Empire. After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, his son Alexander became the ruler. In 335 BC, Alexander destroyed Thebes, which had rebelled. He then quickly conquered Babylon and Persia (see [Daniel 8:5–8](https://ref.ly/Dan8:5-Dan8:8)). When Alexander died suddenly in 323 BC, his vast territories were divided among four generals. After some conflict, three major regions formed:

1. Egypt
2. Asia Minor, Syria, and Babylon
3. Macedonia and Achaia

Alexander's conquests spread Greek culture and influence across the ancient world. This clash between Greek culture and Judaism led to the Maccabean revolt in Judea in the 160s BC.

### Roman Rule (168 BC to AD 330\)

Rome began expanding its power into Greece in 198 BC. In 168 BC, Rome defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna. By 148 BC, Rome had annexed Macedonia as a province. Then, in 146 BC, Rome destroyed Corinth. Greece was now firmly under Roman control and remained so until Emperor Constantine made Byzantium the capital of the Roman Empire in AD 330\. Greek culture and Roman rule set the stage for the life of Jesus and the start of Christianity.
