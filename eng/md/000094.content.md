## Rebekah (id: 500459)

Rebekah was the wife of Isaac. [Genesis 24](https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:67) tells the story of Abraham’s servant who seeks a wife for Isaac. Following Abraham’s instructions, he traveled to Haran in Aram\-naharaim (northwest Mesopotamia) to find Abraham’s relatives. Abraham did not want Isaac to marry a local Canaanite. The servant prayed that the woman God chose for Isaac would offer him a drink and also water his camels ([Genesis 24:12–14](https://ref.ly/Gen24:12-Gen24:14)). This would confirm God’s choice and show her character, hospitality, and work ethic.

God clearly answered his prayer by providing Rebekah, Bethuel's daughter ([Genesis 22:23](https://ref.ly/Gen22:23); [25:20](https://ref.ly/Gen25:20)). Bethuel was the son of Abraham's brother Nahor ([24:24](https://ref.ly/Gen24:24)).

Abraham’s servant explained how God guided him ([Genesis 24:34–49](https://ref.ly/Gen24:34-Gen24:49)). Rebekah’s family saw it as God's work, but they hesitated to let her leave right away ([24:50–56](https://ref.ly/Gen24:50-Gen24:56)). However, Rebekah showed faith in God's plan and was ready to leave her family immediately to marry Isaac ([Genesis 24:57–58](https://ref.ly/Gen24:57-Gen24:58)). Rebekah's faith was greatly rewarded. The blessing her family gave her when she left came true when she had the next generation of God's chosen line with Isaac ([Genesis 24:59–60](https://ref.ly/Gen24:59-Gen24:60)).

Rebekah gave birth to twins, Esau and Jacob ([Genesis 25:20–26](https://ref.ly/Gen25:20-Gen25:26)). She favored Jacob, the younger son, because God told her he would be stronger and lead the two ([Genesis 25:23](https://ref.ly/Gen25:23)). Rebekah helped Jacob take the firstborn's blessing by tricking Isaac ([Genesis 27:1–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40)). She then arranged for Jacob to go to Haran to escape Esau's anger ([Genesis 27:41–28:5](https://ref.ly/Gen27:41-Gen28:5)). Rebekah's deceit caused a lasting division in the family. She likely never saw Jacob again. However, she was buried with Isaac in the family burial site ([Genesis 49:31](https://ref.ly/Gen49:31)). She fulfilled God's plan as the mother of Jacob, the founding father of Israel.
