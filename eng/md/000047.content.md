## Isaiah (id: 500522)

Isaiah was a prophet from Judah during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. He was the son of Amoz ([Isaiah 1:1](https://ref.ly/Isa1:1)). He might have been related to King Amaziah. Isaiah lived in Jerusalem, was well\-educated, and greatly understood human nature. He served as a prophet for a long time, from about 740 to 685 BC. As Judah's political and religious advisor, he had access to kings and was likely the court historian ([2 Chronicles 26:22](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:22); [32:32](https://ref.ly/2Chr32:32)). Isaiah's wife was called a "prophetess" (see Study Note on [Isaiah 8:3](https://ref.ly/Isa8:3)). Their sons were Shear\-jashub and Maher\-shalal\-hash\-baz ([Isaiah 7:3](https://ref.ly/Isa7:3); [8:3](https://ref.ly/Isa8:3)).

Isaiah opposed all social and political evil. He criticized fortune\-tellers and rebuked kings for their stubbornness and indifference. He condemned wealthy, influential people who ignored their duties. He urged everyone to follow God's covenant. Isaiah opposed Canaanite idolatry and insincere religious practices ([Isaiah 1:10–17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:17); [29:13](https://ref.ly/Isa29:13)). He warned of judgment and stated that only a righteous few would survive ([Isaiah 6:11–13](https://ref.ly/Isa6:11-Isa6:13)). He predicted the coming Messiah, a peaceful prince of God's kingdom ([Isaiah 9:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6-Isa9:7); [11:1–11](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:11)). The Messiah would also be an obedient, suffering servant ([53:3–12](https://ref.ly/Isa53:3-Isa53:12)). The book of Isaiah has more connections to the New Testament than any other Old Testament book and is often quoted by New Testament authors.
