## Ishmael (id: 500454)

Ishmael was Abraham’s first son, born to Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian servant. The boy was born near Hebron when Abraham was eighty\-six years old ([Genesis 13:18](https://ref.ly/Gen13:18); [16:16](https://ref.ly/Gen16:16)). God promised to make a great nation from the childless Abraham ([Genesis 12:2](https://ref.ly/Gen12:2)). God assured him he would have a son as his heir ([15:4](https://ref.ly/Gen15:4)). Ishmael was born when Abraham tried to fulfill God’s promise by human means (see [Genesis 16:1–16](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:16); [Galatians 4:23](https://ref.ly/Gal4:23)). But God would still achieve his purposes through Sarah (see [Genesis 17:15–18:15](https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:18); [21:1–7](https://ref.ly/Gen21:1-Gen21:7)).

God said Sarah would have a son to fulfill the promise ([Genesis 17:15–16](https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:16)). Abraham asked God to accept Ishmael ([17:17–18](https://ref.ly/Gen17:17-Gen17:18)). Ishmael was not the promised son because God's special agreement (covenant) would be with Isaac ([Genesis 17:19](https://ref.ly/Gen17:19)). Still, God blessed Ishmael and made him the father of a great nation ([Genesis 17:20–21](https://ref.ly/Gen17:20-Gen17:21)).

When Ishmael was thirteen, he was circumcised as part of God's covenant with Abraham ([Genesis 17:9–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14), [23–27](https://ref.ly/Gen17:23-Gen17:27)). At Isaac's weaning celebration, when Ishmael was about seventeen, he mocked Isaac ([Genesis 21:9](https://ref.ly/Gen21:9)). As a result, Abraham sent Ishmael and Hagar away with supplies. An angel of God helped Hagar survive in the wilderness, and Ishmael became a hunter. He settled in the wilderness of Paran and married an Egyptian woman ([Genesis 21:20–21](https://ref.ly/Gen21:20-Gen21:21)). Ishmael helped bury Abraham ([Genesis 25:9–10](https://ref.ly/Gen25:9-Gen25:10)). He gave his daughter Mahalath in marriage to Esau ([28:9](https://ref.ly/Gen28:9)). Abraham died at age 137 ([25:17](https://ref.ly/Gen25:17)). His twelve sons are listed in [Genesis 25:13–15](https://ref.ly/Gen25:13-Gen25:15).

Paul mentioned Ishmael to encourage the Galatians to trust in God instead of the law (see [Galatians 4:21–31](https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31)). Those who rely on the law will not inherit the kingdom, just as the slave woman's son did not inherit with the free woman's son ([Galatians 4:30](https://ref.ly/Gal4:30)).
