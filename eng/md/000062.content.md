## John, Son of Zebedee (id: 500551)

John was one of Jesus' twelve closest followers ( called apostles). He was the brother of James and the son of Zebedee. Jesus chose these twelve men as his special representatives and gave them authority to teach others about him. Their work helped start the early church. Early tradition says John, Son of Zebedee, wrote the Gospel of John, the Letters of John, and the Book of Revelation.

John and his brother James were among Jesus' closest followers ([Mark 5:37](https://ref.ly/Mark5:37); [9:2](https://ref.ly/Mark9:2); [13:3](https://ref.ly/Mark13:3); [14:33](https://ref.ly/Mark14:33)). Their mother, Salome, might have been Mary's sister, who was Jesus' mother (compare [Matthew 27:56](https://ref.ly/Matt27:56); [Mark 15:40](https://ref.ly/Mark15:40); [16:1](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1); [John 19:25](https://ref.ly/John19:25)). John's name usually appears after James's, suggesting John was younger. James and John were fishermen like their father ([Matthew 4:21](https://ref.ly/Matt4:21); [Mark 1:19](https://ref.ly/Mark1:19)). They fished with Peter and Andrew, another pair of brothers who became disciples ([Luke 5:8–10](https://ref.ly/Luke5:8-Luke5:10)). 

They were among the first disciples Jesus called, and they left everything to follow him ([Matthew 4:22](https://ref.ly/Matt4:22); [Mark 1:20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:20); [Luke 5:11](https://ref.ly/Luke5:11); compare [John 1:35–40](https://ref.ly/John1:35-John1:40)). Jesus named them “Sons of Thunder” ([Mark 3:17](https://ref.ly/Mark3:17)). This name might mean they were loud or quick\-tempered (see [Luke 9:54](https://ref.ly/Luke9:54)). At one point, the brothers upset the other disciples by asking for special positions in the future kingdom ([Matthew 20:20–28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:20-Matt20:28); [Mark 10:35–45](https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:45); compare [Luke 22:24–27](https://ref.ly/Luke22:24-Luke22:27)).

People believe John is the unnamed "disciple Jesus loved" and "another disciple" mentioned in the Gospel of John ([John 13:23–25](https://ref.ly/John13:23-John13:25); [18:15–16](https://ref.ly/John18:15-John18:16); [19:26–27](https://ref.ly/John19:26-John19:27); [20:2–10](https://ref.ly/John20:2-John20:10); [21:20–24](https://ref.ly/John21:20-John21:24)). He might have been the unnamed disciple of John the Baptist who, along with Andrew, became an early follower of Jesus ([John 1:35–40](https://ref.ly/John1:35-John1:40)).

John's name appears three times in Acts. Each time, he works with Peter ([Acts 3:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:11); [4:1–23](https://ref.ly/Acts4:1-Acts4:23); [8:14–25](https://ref.ly/Acts8:14-Acts8:25)). Paul called him one of the "pillars" of the church in Jerusalem ([Galatians 2:9](https://ref.ly/Gal2:9)). This meant John was an important leader in the Jerusalem church.

The most common tradition about John's later life is that he moved to Ephesus, where he eventually became the bishop of Asia Minor. He lived to an old age and died peacefully among friends. John's Gospel gives a deep picture of Jesus, and his letters ([1 John](https://ref.ly/1John1:1-1John5:21), [2 John](https://ref.ly/2John1:1-2John1:13), and [3 John](https://ref.ly/3John1:1-3John1:14)) offer an inspiring view of the Christian life.
