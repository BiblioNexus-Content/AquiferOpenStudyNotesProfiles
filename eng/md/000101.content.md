## Samuel (id: 500489)

Samuel lived at the end of the time of the judges and helped lead Israel into the time of kings. He was Israel’s last judge ([1 Samuel 7:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:6), [15–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:15-1Sam7:17)). Samuel is often seen as Israel’s first prophet ([1 Samuel 3:20](https://ref.ly/1Sam3:20); [Acts 3:24](https://ref.ly/Acts3:24); [13:20](https://ref.ly/Acts13:20)). He served as a priest (see [1 Samuel 2:18](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:18)). He was a man of great faith ([Hebrews 11:32](https://ref.ly/Heb11:32)).

Samuel was born because his mother Hannah prayed for him. Samuel’s parents traveled each year from Ramah to the sanctuary at Shiloh ([1 Samuel 1:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:3)). At the sanctuary, Hannah, who could not have children, prayed for a son and promised to dedicate him to God for full\-time service ([1 Samuel 1:9–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:9-1Sam1:11)). God answered her prayer, and Samuel was born ([1 Samuel 1:19–20](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:19-1Sam1:20)). When Samuel was old enough, Hannah took him to serve in the sanctuary with Eli, the high priest ([1 Samuel 1:24–28](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:24-1Sam1:28); [2:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:11)).

Eli's sons were wicked, but Samuel served the Lord. It soon became clear that God spoke more closely with Samuel than with Eli. God warned Samuel about the disaster coming to Eli's family ([1 Samuel 3:1–18](https://ref.ly/1Sam3:1-1Sam3:18)). This prophecy came true when the Philistines defeated Israel, killed Eli's sons, and took the ark of the covenant ([1 Samuel 4:1–22](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:1-1Sam4:22)). Later, under Samuel's leadership, the people repented for their idolatry (worship of false gods) and won an important battle against the Philistines ([1 Samuel 7:3–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:3-1Sam7:17)).

As Samuel grew older, it became clear he had the same weakness as Eli. Samuel’s sons were evil ([1 Samuel 8:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:1-1Sam8:3)), and the people did not want them to lead the nation. Instead, they asked Samuel to appoint a king to lead them in battle against their enemies ([1 Samuel 8:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:4-1Sam8:5)). Samuel then anointed Saul as Israel's first king ([1 Samuel 9:1–10:24](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:1-1Sam10:24)).

The change from the time of the judges to having kings was difficult. Samuel, as a priest, prayed for the people. As a prophet, he criticized Saul for being impatient and disobedient ([1 Samuel 13:5–14](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:5-1Sam13:14); [15:12–35](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:12-1Sam15:35)). When God rejected Saul as king, Samuel anointed David as God's chosen one ([1 Samuel 16:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:1-1Sam16:13)) and protected David from Saul ([19:18–24](https://ref.ly/1Sam19:18-1Sam19:24)).

Through prayer and determination, Samuel was a faithful leader ([Jeremiah 15:1](https://ref.ly/Jer15:1); [Hebrews 11:32](https://ref.ly/Heb11:32)). He cared deeply for his people and bravely corrected kings and elders. He united Israel from tribal divisions into a strong nation and established a system of rule by kings. He likely wrote *The Record of Samuel the Seer* ([1 Chronicles 29:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:29)). He wrote down how a good king should rule ([1 Samuel 10:25](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:25)). When he died, all of Israel mourned him. He was buried in Ramah, his hometown ([1 Samuel 25:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:1)).
