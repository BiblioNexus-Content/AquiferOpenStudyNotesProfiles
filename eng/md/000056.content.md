## Jethro (Reuel) (id: 500469)

Jethro, also known as Reuel ([Exodus 2:16–18](https://ref.ly/Exod2:16-Exod2:18); [Numbers 10:29](https://ref.ly/Num10:29)), was the priest of Midian ([Exodus 2:16](https://ref.ly/Exod2:16)). Moses saved Jethro’s seven daughters from rough shepherds at a well and helped them water their flocks. At home, they told their father about this surprising encounter with an Egyptian. Jethro was grateful and invited Moses for a meal. Moses decided to settle there. Later, Jethro gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.

While Moses lived in Midian with his father\-in\-law, he met God at the burning bush ([Exodus 3:1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod3:2)). Before going to Egypt, Moses asked Jethro for permission to leave. Later, he sent his family to stay with Jethro during the exodus from Egypt.

While Moses and the Israelites were in the wilderness, Jethro returned with Moses' family. Jethro heard about Yahweh saving his people from Egypt and recognized him as greater than all other gods. He worshiped Yahweh with a burnt offering and sacrifices, aligning himself with Israel ([Exodus 18:11](https://ref.ly/Exod18:11)). In response, Israel's leaders joined him for a sacrificial meal in God's presence ([Exodus 18:12](https://ref.ly/Exod18:12)).

Jethro noticed Moses was overwhelmed with managing the many Israelites. He advised Moses on organizing the people better and resolving their disputes ([Exodus 18:13–23](https://ref.ly/Exod18:13-Exod18:23)). Moses followed this advice and chose capable men to help as leaders and judges ([Exodus 18:24–27](https://ref.ly/Exod18:24-Exod18:27)). Jethro returned to Midian and did not interact further with Israel, but his son ([Numbers 10:29–33](https://ref.ly/Num10:29-Num10:33)) and other descendants later settled with the Israelites ([Judges 1:16](https://ref.ly/Judg1:16); [4:11](https://ref.ly/Judg4:11)).
