## Bathsheba (id: 500492)

Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, was Eliam's daughter ([2 Samuel 11:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:3); see also [1 Chronicles 3:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:5)). She was Ahithophel's granddaughter, the king's adviser ([2 Samuel 15:12](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:12); [23:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34)). Her husband, Uriah, was a Hittite soldier. He was in King David's army and was one of David's mighty warriors ([2 Samuel 23:39](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:39)).

One spring, David stayed home in Jerusalem while the army went to battle ([2 Samuel 11:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1)). Resting at midday, David walked on his roof overlooking the city and saw the beautiful Bathsheba bathing. He arranged for her to be brought to his private chambers. He then had sexual relations with her, and she became pregnant ([2 Samuel 11:2–4](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:2-2Sam11:4)).

David did not want people to find out what he had done wrong, so he tried to hide it. He told Joab, the general, to have Uriah bring back a report from the battle lines. David hoped Uriah would return home and have sexual relations with Bathsheba. This would make it look like she had become pregnant by Uriah. However, Uriah felt he was still on duty, so he slept at the palace gate instead ([2 Samuel 11:5–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:5-2Sam11:13)).

 When David asked him about this, Uriah said he could not sleep with his wife while the ark of the covenant and Israel's armies were at war. This response made David look bad. Uriah was not even an Israelite, but he was ready to return to battle by avoiding being with his wife (see [Leviticus 15:16–18](https://ref.ly/Lev15:16-Lev15:18)). But David stayed home and tried to hide his adultery. Then David sent Uriah back and ordered Joab to ensure Uriah died in battle ([2 Samuel 11:14–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:14-2Sam11:25)). Uriah’s death did not keep David’s sin secret. The Lord sent the prophet Nathan to confront David, and David confessed his sin and repented ([2 Samuel 12:1–14](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1-2Sam12:14); see [Psalm 51](https://ref.ly/Ps51:1-Ps51:19)).

Bathsheba's baby became sick and died, as Nathan had predicted. After Bathsheba's mourning period, David brought her to the palace as his wife. David and Bathsheba had other children, including: 

* Shimea
* Shobab
* Nathan
* Solomon ([2 Samuel 12:15–25](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:15-2Sam12:25); [1 Chronicles 3:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:5))

For the rest of David's life, his wives and children fought against each other for power. The worst of this family fighting happened when David was old. At that time, Bathsheba worked to make sure her son Solomon would become the next king ([1 Kings 1:1–53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1-1Kgs1:53)).

When Matthew lists Jesus the Messiah's family history, he mentions both Solomon and Bathsheba ([Matthew 1:6](https://ref.ly/Matt1:6)). She is described as “Uriah’s wife.” This reminds us of the sin that brought her into David’s family and of God’s gracious favor toward her descendants.
