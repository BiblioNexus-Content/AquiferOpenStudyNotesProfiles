## Simon Peter (id: 500537)

Simon Peter was the main leader among Jesus' twelve closest followers (called apostles). After Jesus' death, he became the main person to speak officially for early Christians in Jerusalem. He was the apostle mainly responsible for sharing the good news about Jesus with the Jews ([Galatians 2:7–8](https://ref.ly/Gal2:7-Gal2:8)).

The Hebrew name *Simeon* (spelled in English as “Simon”) was likely his original name. *Cephas* is the transliteration of an Aramaic name that Jesus gave him, meaning “rock.” In Greek, this is translated as *Petros* (English “Peter”; see [Matthew 16:17–18](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17-Matt16:18); [John 1:42](https://ref.ly/John1:42)).

Bethsaida was Peter's hometown ([John 1:44](https://ref.ly/John1:44)). Peter later moved to Capernaum. He was married ([1 Corinthians 9:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:5)). When Jesus visited Peter's home, he healed Peter's mother\-in\-law ([Matthew 8:14–15](https://ref.ly/Matt8:14-Matt8:15); [Mark 1:29–31](https://ref.ly/Mark1:29-Mark1:31); [Luke 4:38–39](https://ref.ly/Luke4:38-Luke4:39)).

Peter and his brother Andrew were fishermen. Jesus called them to be among his first disciples, along with their fishing partners, James and John ([Matthew 4:18–22](https://ref.ly/Matt4:18-Matt4:22); [Mark 1:16–20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:16-Mark1:20); see also [Luke 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/Luke5:1-Luke5:11); [John 1:35–51](https://ref.ly/John1:35-John1:51)). They were ordinary working men with little formal education ([Acts 4:13](https://ref.ly/Acts4:13)).

Peter's name appears first on every list of the twelve apostles ([Matthew 10:2](https://ref.ly/Matt10:2); [Mark 3:16](https://ref.ly/Mark3:16); [Luke 6:14](https://ref.ly/Luke6:14); [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13)). Along with the brothers James and John, Peter was part of a close group of disciples who were with Jesus during special events. These included:

* the healing of Jairus's daughter ([Mark 5:37](https://ref.ly/Mark5:37); [Luke 8:51](https://ref.ly/Luke8:51)),
* Jesus' transfiguration when his appearance changed ([Matthew 17:1–2](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:2); [Mark 9:2](https://ref.ly/Mark9:2); [Luke 9:28–29](https://ref.ly/Luke9:28-Luke9:29)), and
* Jesus' prayer in the garden of Gethsemane ([Matthew 26:37](https://ref.ly/Matt26:37); [Mark 14:33](https://ref.ly/Mark14:33)).

Peter was bold and impulsive ([Matthew 26:33](https://ref.ly/Matt26:33); [Mark 14:29](https://ref.ly/Mark14:29); [Luke 5:8](https://ref.ly/Luke5:8); [22:33](https://ref.ly/Luke22:33); [John 13:36–37](https://ref.ly/John13:36-John13:37); [21:7](https://ref.ly/John21:7)). He was the first disciple to declare his belief in Jesus as God's chosen leader, the Messiah (or "Christ," [Matthew 16:15–16](https://ref.ly/Matt16:15-Matt16:16); [Mark 8:29](https://ref.ly/Mark8:29); [Luke 9:20](https://ref.ly/Luke9:20)). When Jesus talked about his upcoming death, Peter told him he was wrong. This did not match Peter's idea of the Messiah. Jesus strongly corrected Peter for this ([Matthew 16:21–23](https://ref.ly/Matt16:21-Matt16:23); [Mark 8:31–33](https://ref.ly/Mark8:31-Mark8:33)). However, Jesus said Peter would be a key person to help establish the church ([Matthew 16:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18-Matt16:19)).

Peter secretly entered the high priest's courtyard when they took Jesus there for questioning. People recognized Peter, partly because of his Galilean accent, and challenged him. He strongly denied knowing Jesus, just as Jesus had predicted, despite Peter's saying earlier that he would never do so ([Matthew 26:69–75](https://ref.ly/Matt26:69-Matt26:75); [Mark 14:66–72](https://ref.ly/Mark14:66-Mark14:72); [Luke 22:54–62](https://ref.ly/Luke22:54-Luke22:62)). Peter immediately felt deep remorse ([Matthew 26:33–35](https://ref.ly/Matt26:33-Matt26:35); [Mark 14:29–31](https://ref.ly/Mark14:29-Mark14:31); [Luke 22:31–34](https://ref.ly/Luke22:31-Luke22:34)).

After hearing about Jesus' resurrection, Peter was one of the first to run to the tomb to check if it was true ([John 20:3–7](https://ref.ly/John20:3-John20:7)). He seems to have been the first of the twelve apostles to whom the risen Jesus appeared ([Luke 24:33–34](https://ref.ly/Luke24:33-Luke24:34); [1 Corinthians 15:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:5)). Much of Jesus' conversation in [John 21](https://ref.ly/John21:1-John21:25) was with Peter. Jesus encouraged him to "feed my lambs" ([John 21:15–17](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17)).

After the Holy Spirit came on the Day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:1–13](https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:13)), Peter became the main apostle to speak officially for the early Christians. From then on, as noted in [Acts 2:14–12:25](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14-Acts12:25), he played a key role in spreading the good news about Jesus in Judea. 

* He boldly preached to the crowds ([Acts 2:14–41](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14-Acts2:41); [3:12–26](https://ref.ly/Acts3:12-Acts3:26))
* He healed people ([Acts 3:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:11); [5:12–16](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12-Acts5:16); [9:32–43](https://ref.ly/Acts9:32-Acts9:43))
* He spoke fearlessly to the authorities even when arrested ([Acts 4:1–20](https://ref.ly/Acts4:1-Acts4:20); [5:26–32](https://ref.ly/Acts5:26-Acts5:32))
* He miraculously escaped from prison twice ([Acts 5:18–25](https://ref.ly/Acts5:18-Acts5:25); [12:6–11](https://ref.ly/Acts12:6-Acts12:11))
* He also led in managing the quickly growing community of disciples ([Acts 5:3–11](https://ref.ly/Acts5:3-Acts5:11))

Peter was the first to share the good news about Jesus with non\-Jews ([Acts 10:1–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts10:48); see [Matthew 16:18](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18)). He played a key role in the Jerusalem council about non\-Jewish converts. He argued that non\-Jews should not have to follow the law of Moses. Instead, they should be accepted based on their faith in Jesus alone ([Acts 15:7–11](https://ref.ly/Acts15:7-Acts15:11)). Later, when visiting Antioch, he was inconsistent about this. Paul strongly criticized him for it ([Galatians 2:11–16](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:16)).

Peter brought his wife on some mission trips ([1 Corinthians 9:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:5)). We do not know many other details about Peter’s later life and missionary work. He might have spent time in Corinth ([1 Corinthians 1:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:12); [3:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:22)). Early tradition says that Peter was crucified (killed by being nailed to a cross) in Rome during Nero’s persecution of Christians in AD 64–65\. Jesus said this would happen ([John 21:18–19](https://ref.ly/John21:18-John21:19)). The tradition that he was crucified upside\-down is less certain.

Peter likely provided the information that Mark recorded in his Gospel. Mark probably learned this while helping Peter with his evangelistic work in Italy near the end of Peter's life. Tradition also says that Peter wrote 1 Peter (from Rome, referred to as "Babylon," [1 Peter 5:13](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:13)) and 2 Peter.

In the New Testament, Peter shows how Jesus forgives and restores those who have failed him. Jesus can still use them for his glory.
