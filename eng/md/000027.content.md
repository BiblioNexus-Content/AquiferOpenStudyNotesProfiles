## Egypt (id: 500467)

Egypt was a great and ancient civilization when Joseph rose to power and Jacob’s family traveled there for food ([Genesis 39–41](https://ref.ly/Gen39:1-Gen41:57); [42–46](https://ref.ly/Gen42:1-Gen46:34); compare [12:10–20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20)). Egypt was well protected from enemies because of where it was located. The Mediterranean Sea to the north had no harbors. The rough Sinai Peninsula lay to the east, and a huge desert stretched to the west. This natural protection made Egypt a safe place for people from other lands during times when there was no rain.

People call Egypt "the gift of the Nile" because no other river has been so essential to a nation's history. Egyptians referred to it as "the River." The Nile is more than the longest river in the world. Without its water, civilization in Egypt would not have existed. The Nile is Egypt's lifeline, and Egyptians worshiped it for the life and fertility it provided. The river's yearly floods brought new, fertile soil for crops. The river provided fish and birds for food, along with clean water for drinking and washing. It also served as the main route for travel, trade, and communication. During droughts, when nearby nations faced famine, the Nile gave Egypt a steady supply of fresh water. The Nile shaped every part of life in Egypt and made Egypt what it was.

Egypt played an important role in biblical events. Abraham lived there during a famine ([Genesis 12:10–20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20)). Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt and became a leader, similar to a prime minister ([Genesis 37–41](https://ref.ly/Gen37:1-Gen41:57)). Joseph’s family later moved to the eastern delta region of Goshen during another famine ([Genesis 42–50](https://ref.ly/Gen42:1-Gen50:26)). Their descendants were eventually enslaved ([Exodus 1](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1-Exod1:22)). God's rescue of his people during the exodus from Egypt became a key story for the Jewish people ([Exodus 2–15](https://ref.ly/Exod2:1-Exod15:27)).

Later, when Israel was ruled by kings, Egypt often joined the fight for international power (for example, [1 Kings 14:25–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:25-1Kgs14:28)). After the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem in 586 BC, some Jews moved to Egypt to escape Babylon’s control ([Jeremiah 43:6–7](https://ref.ly/Jer43:6-Jer43:7)).

At the start of the New Testament, Egypt became a safe place for Joseph, Mary, and Jesus. They escaped there to avoid Herod the Great's attempts to kill Jesus ([Matthew 2:13–23](https://ref.ly/Matt2:13-Matt2:23)).
