## Luke (id: 500561)

Luke was a gentile (non\-Jewish) doctor who became a Christian and a trusted helper of Paul in his missions. He wrote both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles, which make up about one\-quarter of the New Testament.

We know little about Luke's background, but he likely first met Paul in western Asia Minor. There, he became a Christian. He left his home to serve Jesus and spread the good news about him as Paul's dedicated assistant. Paul warmly calls him "the beloved physician" and a faithful "fellow worker" ([Colossians 4:14](https://ref.ly/Col4:14); [Philemon 1:24](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:24)). Luke was the only Christian who stayed with Paul when he awaited execution in Rome ([2 Timothy 4:11](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:11)). He is also the only non\-Jewish person whose writings are in the New Testament.

During Paul's last trip to Jerusalem, Luke likely gathered information for his Gospel and the early part of the book of Acts. He interviewed people in Judea while Paul was imprisoned there for two years. Luke spoke with those who heard and saw Jesus and studied what others had written about him. He then wrote his own detailed account of Jesus's life and teachings (see [Luke 1:1–4](https://ref.ly/Luke1:1-Luke1:4)).

When Paul traveled by ship to Rome for his trial, Luke went with him. While Paul was under house arrest, waiting for his trial, Luke might have used this time to write the book of Acts. The first fifteen chapters give an account of the earliest missionary work in the order that it happened and as told to him by the early followers of Jesus. Paul himself probably told him some of these things. Starting at [Acts 16:10](https://ref.ly/Acts16:10), Luke writes about what he saw and experienced himself when he joined Paul's team. In Acts, Luke emphasizes how the Holy Spirit empowered and guided the early missionaries in their work (see [Acts 1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts1:4-Acts1:5), [8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)). The book ends with Paul still under house arrest in Rome ([Acts 28:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts28:30-Acts28:31)).

We owe Luke for many unique passages. These include his account of Jesus’s birth, descriptions of Jesus’s ministry to women, and many words about Jesus caring for the poor. He also provides the only comprehensive account of the first thirty years of Christian missionary activity, all carefully documented. Through Luke’s writings, we gain a deeper appreciation of the crucial work of the Holy Spirit in the ministry of Jesus and the early missionaries.
